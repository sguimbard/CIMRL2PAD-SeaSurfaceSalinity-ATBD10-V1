<h1>Algorithm Performance Assessment (Version 2 ATBD)<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithm-performance-assessment-version-2-atbd" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>To assess the performance of the previously described OWV retrieval algorithm, we used the SCEPS prototype simulator to generate a very large test card (~6000 km × 4000 km), with 1 km resolution including strong SSS gradients due to the Amazon River plume, and strong surface wind speed gradients with the presence of two hurricanes (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure25"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22</span></a>).</p>
<p>As described in RD.2, the simulator consists of a single statically-linked Linux executable program, <strong>cimrProject</strong>, which produces a Level 1b antenna temperature product from input scene brightness information. The program takes as input an EO-CFI orbit definition file (Team, 2022), a file containing the scene brightness temperature in the form of a <em>test card</em>, complete GRASP-generated antenna patterns provided by industry, and a file that specifies the sample times at which to produce antenna temperatures.</p>
<p>The scene brightness includes both the isotropic and anisotropic complete modified Stokes vector (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_h\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_p\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span>) in the surface polarization basis. The isotropic part can vary with incidence angle, while, for practical reasons in our analyses, the anisotropic part is assumed to be independent of incidence angle.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A schematic of the overall retrieval algorithm assessment using SCEPS is provided in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure24"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 21</span></a>. The assessment is based upon these successive steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The scene is first described by geophysical fields, including: SSS, SST, OWV at ~1 km spatial resolution and then interpolated (in space and time) atmospheric vertical parameters from ERA5.</p></li>
<li><p>The TOA brightness temperatures are then evaluated for all CIMR frequencies and polarization using the previously described RTM for an ensemble of incidence angles. The azimuthal harmonic contributions to total TOA temperature are also evaluated separately.</p></li>
<li><p>The computation of (noisy) simulated CIMR antenna temperature from the scene brightness temperature field involves several aspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3.1 Calculation of orbit and viewing geometry,</p></li>
<li><p>3.2 Calculation of the scene brightness Stokes vector,</p></li>
<li><p>3.3 Integration of the scene brightness over the antenna patterns (both near and far from the feed boresights) for each horn.</p></li>
<li><p>3.4 Addition of NEDT noise to the antenna temperatures,</p></li>
<li><p>3.5 Calculation and application of the Antenna Pattern Correction (APC) matrices for all feeds, to reduce/remove cross-pol contamination. For these tests, this APC has the polarization basis rotation <em>built-in</em>;</p></li>
<li><p>3.6 Production of a preliminary version of the Level 1b product.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Resampled brightness temperature are then computed by applying the Backus-Gilbert method to express in the surface polarization basis:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>SCEPS uses elliptical power patterns (on Earth) to compute the BG inner products.</p></li>
<li><p>Fore and aft sampled can be combined or kept separated in fore and aft images.</p></li>
<li><p>The Target grid is the original test card at 1 km resolution and the target patterns are all circular Gaussians with FWHM for L, C, X, Ku, and Ka band defined as follows: 60, 30, 30, 8, and 8 km.</p></li>
<li><p>A single application of BG yields weights that can be applied to all antenna pattern contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>Maps of error variance amplification factors are computed from the BG weights.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The noisy simulated resampled CIMR L1b antenna temperature from the scene brightness temperature field are then used for simulation of the future CIMR remapped <em>‘measured L1B Tbs’</em>.</p></li>

<h2>Geophysical Data Used to Describe the Ocean Scene<a class="headerlink" href="#geophysical-data-used-to-describe-the-ocean-scene" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The synthetic wind field used to model the scene is a merge between ERA5 re-analyses used as the background wind field, and more local and high-resolution surface winds from Sentinel-1/2 SAR data around two hurricanes. The SSS is from the MERCATOR model. The SST is from ERA5 re-analyses, which were also used to simulate the atmospheric vertical profiles. The test scene includes several coasts to analyze the land-contamination.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the Forward Model simulations, we assumed the anisotropic roughness effects to be similar at all EIA values. ERA5 vertical profiles for Cloud Liquid, Ice Water Content, air temperature, humidity were used to evaluate the atmospheric contributions at each frequency. Land Tbs &gt; 300K are from the SCEPS project (courtesy Carlos Jimenez). Example of such Tb fields are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure26"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 23</span></a>.</p>

<p>Details about each step of the SCEPS simulator can be found in [RD.2]. The simulator includes an orbit propagator to simulate the orbiting satellite positions in time and an antenna geometry routine to simulate the antenna scanning geometry and integrate the brightness fields over the antenna power patterns.</p>
<p>Noting that most of the power originates near the feed boresight, the integration domain is divided into an inner and an outer domain. These domains are defined for each feed (*see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure28"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 25</span></a>): The inner domain includes the boresight and extends out to an ellipse corresponding to an azimuthally averaged power 40 dB below the peak (at the feed boresight), where the azimuthal average is computed in the tilted direction cosine coordinate system.  The outer domain covers the rest of the Front Half-Space (FHS) of antenna (containing boresight) in either the tilted or un-tilted coordinate system.</p>

<p>The CIMR instrument consists of 25 feeds, with one at L-band, 4 at C/X bands, and 8 at Ku/Ka bands. <a class="reference internal" href="#figure29"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 26</span></a> shows the measurement (full integration time) footprints for a portion of three successive scans for the L-, C-band, X-band, and Ku-band horns. The figure illustrates the extent of overlap between successive footprints both along and across the scan near the swath center. Although overlap can be increased (at the expense of increased noise) along the scan by using individual samples, the across-scan overlap cannot be changed.  To obtain a resolution consistent with the antenna pattern footprint size, distance between neighboring measurements should not exceed half the Half-Power Beam Width (by the Whittaker–Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem).</p>
<p>As discussed in [RD.2], this condition is not satisfied across scan in L and Ku bands, but is satisfied in C and X bands. For Ku-band, there is no overlap in the half-power footprints across scan, which may be a limiting factor in the resolution of images obtained from resampled antenna temperatures.</p>

<p>The reflector rotation rate is sufficiently fast that the antenna patterns move substantially during the measurement integration times, and this must be accounted for when SCEPS is configured to compute antenna temperatures for the full measurements. To do so, SCEPS extends the antenna pattern integration to include integration over the integration time of the receiver.</p>

<p>Examples of SSS retrieved over the scene is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure31"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 28</span></a>. In these retrieval simulations, the instrument Tbs were derived by integrating the scene over the full antenna patterns (HBS+outer patterns).

<h2>SSS Retrieval simulations: comparison with MRD<a class="headerlink" href="#sss-retrieval-simulations-comparison-with-mrd" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As stated in the CIMR MRD, the mission objectives for SSS retrieval are the following:
“SEC-OBJ-9. Measure Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) over the global ocean from space [AD-
3],[AD-4] with a target gridded spatial resolution of 40 km and uncertainty <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\leq\)</span>0.3 pss over monthly time-scales [AD-3]”</p>
<p>The accuracy of weekly or monthly SSS products from orbiting satellites depends on the number of satellite passes over a given grid cell within the period of time. To evaluate such number for the CIMR L-band data collected over one month, in the MACRAD project [RD.3], we have conducted a sampling analysis with the satellite instrument retrieval simulator for the mission: the CIMR SCEPS. We estimated the number of L1B samples per day in 0.36°x 0.36° rectangular grid (~40km resolution) boxes for the complete month of January 2029. We reproduced some of the results hereafter.</p>

<h3>Error Estimates for individual CIMR L2 SSS<a class="headerlink" href="#error-estimates-for-individual-cimr-l2-sss" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the following, we first estimated the accuracy of the CIMR satellite L2 SSS measurements from the effects of the various error sources at a nominal incidence angle of 52° that were described in detail in [RD.3]. Table 1 summarizes the influence of various geophysical error sources for four water temperature ranges:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Very low SSTs with -4°C &lt; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_s\)</span> &lt; 0°C</p></li>
<li><p>Low SSTs: 0°C &lt; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_s\)</span> &lt; 10°C</p></li>
<li><p>Moderate SSTs: 10°C &lt; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_s\)</span> &lt; 20°C</p></li>
<li><p>Warm SSTs: 20°C &lt; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_s\)</span> &lt; 30°C</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And for each SST range, we investigated the errors for the following three wind speed ranges:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>Low wind speed: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{10} &lt; 5\)</span> m/s</p></li>
<li><p>Moderate wind speed: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5 \leq U_{10} &lt; 15\)</span> m/s</p></li>
<li><p>High wind speed: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{10} &gt; 15\)</span> m/s</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In [RD.3], we performed sensitivity analyses from the RTM presented in this ATBD. For each temperature and wind speed range, the estimated brightness temperature errors were listed for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_v\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_h\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((T_v + T_h)/2\)</span>. The estimates for the average brightness temperature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((T_v + T_h)/2\)</span> were included because it is insensitive to the Faraday rotation.</p>
<p>We provided the sensitivity of the brightness temperatures to SSS and SST, indicating a varying degree of sensitivity versus polarization and water temperature, as well as the sensitivity to surface wind speed and direction. We also estimated the sensitivity to air surface temperature, surface pressure, columnar water vapor content, and cloud liquid water content. Additionally, we provided the residual brightness temperature errors after data corrections or under an assumed threshold for data flags related to external sources (e.g., galactic and solar glints). Land-sea contamination was filtered (e.g., all data within a 70 km band from coasts were not considered).</p>
<p>The net effect of geophysical errors is described in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure34"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 31</span></a> under the assumption that all geophysical error sources are uncorrelated.</p>

<p>For individual L-band measurements, the square Root of the Sum of Squares (RSS) of quantity is varying from about 0.5 K to 1.2 K, depending on SST and Wind Speed and on polarization. One of the dominant error sources is the surface roughness (e.g., wind speed). The second most impacting effect is NEDT and radiometer stability. Contrarily to V-polarization (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure35"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 32</span></a>), the RSS do not increase monotonically with increasing wind speed for H-polarization because the sensitivity to wind speed is higher for low wind speed than for moderate and higher winds (see RD.3). As a reference, 0.1 K corresponds to a wind speed uncertainty of 0.5 m/s- for vertical polarization and 0.25 m/s- for horizontal polarization.</p>

<p>The sensor errors include the calibration errors and the radiometer noise-equivalent-delta-T (NEDT). The instrument calibration stability does not include the bias of the instrument calibration errors, and only accounts for the temporal variability of the instrument calibration. It is assumed that the instrument calibration bias is a constant and hence can be removed by a comparative analysis of in-situ measurements. The dominant error sources are the antenna pointing angle, antenna emissivities, and the stability of the calibration device, such as the noise source, for the electronics. The radiometer NEDT is assumed to be 0.3 K for each polarization.</p>
<p>As found, the vertical polarization outperforms the other polarization and combinations because of its superior sensitivity to salinity. In moderate SST and wind conditions, it is about ~1 pss. It increases with increasing wind speed and decreasing SST. The average brightness temperature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((T_v + T_h)/2\)</span> has the advantage of a negligible Faraday rotation error, but its performance is slightly worse than the vertical polarization because of a slight degradation of SSS sensitivity.</p>

<p>In V-polarization, the accuracy ranges from ~0.9 pss to ~3.5 pss depending on wind speed and SST conditions. In H-pol, it is significantly higher, ranging from ~2.5 to 9 pss. The accuracy indicated here is for one satellite observation and approaches 2 pss (vertical polarization) for cold waters and improves with increasing water temperatures to reach about 0.9 psu for warm waters.</p>

<p>To achieve better accuracy, multiple independent observations are needed. The independent measurements can possibly result from temporal or spatial averaging. The temporal averaging involves the average of data from multiple satellite passes over a given surface grid cell. The revisit time is a few hours for high latitudes and 1 to 3 days for equatorial regions; therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the data from different satellite passes are uncorrelated. In contrast, the spatial averaging over the measurements from adjacent antenna footprints may not reduce the error because most of the geophysical error sources and instrument calibration uncertainty are likely to have a spatial correlation.</p>
<p>For the CIMR conical scanner, a correlation time of a few minutes for the instrument calibration error will make the measurements across the entire swath and along the track of about 1800 km correlated. The only error source that definitely can be improved by spatial averaging is the sensor NEDT, which is random. To be conservative, we assume only the measurements from different satellite passes as independent estimates. Under this assumption, the number of satellite passes required to reduce the error to 0.3 pss has been evaluated in [RD.3]. It is about 50 for very cold waters with vertical polarization and diminishes to ~5 for equatorial regions.</p>
<p>It is indicated in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure37"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 34</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#figure38"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 35</span></a> that one month of sampling with the CIMR polar-orbiting L-band instrument results in about 100 passes. This suggests that even during strong sunglint periods (when more than 25% of the data might be contaminated in the Northern Hemisphere), a monthly averaged SSS of 0.3 pss is achievable with the vertical polarization data under the assumptions stated above. An average of the SSS estimates from both polarizations should yield better accuracy.</p>

<h1>Roadmap for future ATBD development<a class="headerlink" href="#roadmap-for-future-atbd-development" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>The prototype CIMR Level-2 OWV retrieval algorithm presented in this ATBD is based on several assumptions and simplifications. Several developments and improvements to the prototype algorithm are planned which have the potential to significantly improve the performance of the CIMR Level-2 OWV algorithm. We highlight a few of them in this chapter.</p>
<section id="new-sea-water-dielectric-constant-model-at-l-band">
<h2>New Sea water dielectric constant model at L-band<a class="headerlink" href="#new-sea-water-dielectric-constant-model-at-l-band" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>At the time this ATBD was developed, two up-to-date parametrizations for the sea water dielectric constant at L-band were available, based on one hand, on the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite multi-angular brightness temperature measurements by Boutin et al. (2021) (BV), and, on the other hand, on the new George Washington University laboratory measurements by Zhou et al. (2021) (GW2020). These two approaches are fully independent. For most SSS and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) conditions commonly observed over the open ocean, the relative variations of brightness temperatures Tb simulated through the BV and GW2020 parametrizations agree particularly well, and better than with earlier parametrizations previously used in the SMOS, SMAP, and Aquarius SSS retrievals. Being based purely on Laboratory data, we therefore advise the use of GW2020 in the present ATBD. However, uncertainty remains, especially below 10°C where a ∼0.1 K relative difference between the two models is observed. This motivated the development of a revised parameterization, BVZ (Boutin, Vergely, and Zhou (2023)), based on a methodology similar to that used to derive BV but using GW2020 instead of SMOS measurements. Compared to the GW2020 parameterization, BVZ is derived with a reduced number of degrees of freedom, it relies on the TEOS10 PSS78 conductivity-salinity relationship, and on the previously derived static permittivity of fresh water. Noting that this new parametrization significantly improved the SSS retrieval from SMOS in the 5°C–15°C SST range, we advise to update the GW2020 L-band sea water dielectric constant model with this new BVZ model in future algorithm developments for CIMR.</p>

<h2>Incidence angle &amp; SST dependencies of the roughness correction<a class="headerlink" href="#incidence-angle-sst-dependencies-of-the-roughness-correction" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The wind induced emissivity model is based on the wind emissivity model of the Aquarius V5 release after extrapolating to the CIMR Earth incidence angle. Small adjustment can be applied to the Aquarius V5 model function due to the fact that the ancillary field used to derive the GMF (CIMR L2 OWV) will be slightly different from the Aquarius HHH wind speed which was used in the Aquarius Version 5 algorithm. Small biases will likely exist between these two ancillary wind fields and are dependent on wind speed as well as SST. Because of the high level of accuracy that is required for retrieving salinity, these biases needed to be considered when deriving the wind induced emissivity model function for CIMR using the method outlined in <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id106" title="Thomas Meissner, Frank J Wentz, and Lucrezia Ricciardulli. The emission and scattering of l-band microwave radiation from rough ocean surfaces and wind speed measurements from the aquarius sensor. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 119(9):6499–6522, 2014.">Meissner <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>]</span>. As a consequence of the slightly different ancillary wind speed inputs to the Aquarius Version 5 and CIMR salinity retrieval, the geophysical model functions for the wind emissivities shall also differ slightly. This is most important for the wind speed dependence 0th harmonic coefficient of the wind induced emissivity i.e., the isotropic part. Small differences can be expected at very low and at very high wind speeds. In addition, one can expected slight differences in the SST dependence of the wind induced emissivity. All these adjustments shall be done post-launch, once co-localized CIMR L-band Tbs, SSS, SST and wind data sets will be made available. Alternatively, roughness emission GMFs at 52° can also be directly inferred from SMOS data but at the expense if a higher NEDT in the Tbs.</p>

<h2>Roughness emission azimuthal harmonics in High winds<a class="headerlink" href="#roughness-emission-azimuthal-harmonics-in-high-winds" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>It remains unclear how the roughness anisotropic emission components (first and second harmonics, see Figure 9 and Figure 10) for all four Stokes parameters behave in high wind speed regimes (say &gt; 20 m/s). Wind-direction signals in passive microwave polarimetry for ocean surfaces under hurricane force winds were however presented in Yueh et al., 2008. They performed analysis of Windsat data for several Atlantic hurricanes from 2003 to 2005. The polarimetric third Stokes parameter observations from the Windsat 10-,18-, and 37-GHz channels were collocated with the ocean-surface winds from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hwind analysis. The collocated data were binned as a function of wind speed and wind direction. The 10-GHz data show clear 4-K peak-to-peak directional signals at 50-60-m/s wind speed after correction for atmospheric attenuation. The signals in the 18- and 37-GHz channels were unclear at above 40-m/s wind speeds, probably caused by the impact of clouds and rain. The data were expanded by sinusoidal series of the relative azimuth angles between the Hwind analysis and observation directions. The coefficients of the sinusoidal series suggest decreasing response to wind direction for increasing wind speed, but the 10-GHz data appear to be fairly constant for up to 50-m/s wind speeds. The trend of the high-wind data (&gt; 25 m/s) is, in general, consistent with the characteristics of the lighter wind data. The combined Windsat–GDAS (&lt; 25 m/s) and Windsat–Hwind (&gt; 25 m/s) analyses show that the amplitude of first-harmonic coefficients (U1) increases with increasing wind speed from low to 20 m/s but then saturates and decreases at higher wind speeds. The amplitude of second harmonic coefficients (U2), having a similar feature, increases with wind speed from light to moderately high wind speed (&lt; 15 m/s) and then displays a decreasing trend beyond about 15–20-m/s wind speeds. This feature is consistent with the active microwave observations of hurricanes. This implies that the ocean waves and other roughness features generated by hurricane force winds will start to lose directionality for increasing wind speed beyond 30–50 m/s. The loss of directionality can be due to a wider azimuthal spreading of wave propagation, increasing coverage of sea foam and spray, and the impact of raindrops on the surface roughness. Excessive attenuation by rain, if undercorrected, may further reduce the directional dependence of U. The ocean waves with longer wavelengths having greater influence on the 10, 6 and 1.4-GHz microwaves probably can sustain better directionality at very high winds than the ocean waves with shorter wavelength, which have greater impact on the 18.7- and 36.5-GHz frequencies. Therefore, in future ATBD developments for CIMR, we suggest to decrease the directional harmonics (1 and 2) towards zero for wind speed higher than 20 m/s.</p>
<section id="simplified-atmospheric-corrections">
<h3>Simplified Atmospheric Corrections<a class="headerlink" href="#simplified-atmospheric-corrections" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Our proposed atmospheric corrections rely on the vertical integration of the indexes of refraction from local atmospheric parameter profiles. This may be unpractical for an operational processing in terms of computing time. In this case, we suggest to follow the approach used in AMSR-E ATBD (Wentz and Meissner, 2000), where approximated vertically integrated absorption coefficients can be derived from vertically integrated water vapor, cloud liquid water, and air temperature.</p>
<p>One approximated approach, valid at L-band, is to follow the simplified single layer atmospheric model used in the ESA SMOS Level 2 Ocean Salinity Processor [RD.4]. The atmospheric contributions are approximated by the following formulation in which the emission and absorption are expressed purely in terms of air surface temperature  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_o\)</span>, surface pressure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_s\)</span>, and total column water vapor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span>. In terms of these quantities, the vertically integrated absorption owing to molecular oxygen and water vapor are, respectively:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
A_d = A_d^{(u)} = A_d^{(d)} = 10^{-6} \left( C_{aao}^{(0)} + C_{aao}^{(1)} T_o + C_{aao}^{(2)} P_s + C_{aao}^{(3)} T_o^2 + C_{aao}^{(4)} P_s^2 + C_{aao}^{(5)} T_o P_s \right)

<h2>Needed and Missing Corrections: retrieval in Coastal Areas and Closer to the Sea Ice Edge<a class="headerlink" href="#needed-and-missing-corrections-retrieval-in-coastal-areas-and-closer-to-the-sea-ice-edge" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The improved resolution of CIMR and stringent beam forming (“distance-to-coast”) requirements mean that Level-2 OWV retrievals can be achieved closer to the coastline. Still, coastal regions and water bodies will be challenging for the CIMR Level-2 products when the main beam overlaps different surface types. This can lead to erroneous coastal OWVs.</p>
<p>Similar challenges exist for retrieval of OWV close to the sea-ice edge. Application of a land-spill over correction and methods for mitigating land contamination (Olmedo et al., 2017; Olmedo et al., 2018) should be investigated, as well as methods to reduce sea-ice contamination (Meissner and Manaster, 2021). It is not fully clear yet at which processing level (1 or 2) the land- and ice-ocean transitions effects shall be corrected for on the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_B\)</span>s (so-called land-sea contamination). Given that these effects require antenna-pattern-related information, it shall better be applied in the Level 1 algorithms.</p>

<h2>SSS uncertainty estimation<a class="headerlink" href="#sss-uncertainty-estimation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A detailed analysis of various geophysical error sources that influence the microwave remote sensing of ocean surface salinity with CIMR sensor has been performed in [RD.3]. The error sources include the sea surface temperature, sea surface roughness, atmospheric gases, ionospheric Faraday rotation, solar and galactic emission sources, as well as the brightness temperature contamination at the land-sea or the sea ice -open ocean transitions. Using the SSS retrieval algorithm developed in this document sensitivity analyses for each of the previous potential error sources for the L2 SSS retrievals were performed. Many of them are shown to have an influence of a few Kelvin, which are not negligible compared with the sensitivity of L-band sea surface brightness temperatures to salinity. An accurate knowledge of these parameters is necessary to enable a correction of the microwave measurements to accurately measure SSS. While uncertainty estimate, shall be part of the output product, we have not yet included it into the algorithm. In [RD3], the method we used for formally assessing random and systematic uncertainties in the CIMR SSS retrievals was presented. The method is based on performing multiple retrievals by perturbing the various inputs to the retrieval algorithm and calculating the sensitivity of the CIMR retrieved SSS to these inputs. Together with an error model for the uncertainties in the input parameters it is possible to calculate the uncertainty in the retrieved salinity. Such approach can be used to partition the retrieval errors in different classes of geophysical conditions (cold to warm SSTs,low to high winds etc..). As found, for individual L-band measurements far away from coasts or ice-edges (&gt; 70 kms), the square Root of the Sum of Squares (RSS) of quantity is varying from about 0.5 K to 1.2 K, depending on SST and Wind Speed and on polarization. As found, an accuracy of 0.3 pss is achievable for a monthly average gridded data set for CIMR polar-orbiting satellite with a swath width of ~1800 km. Two key factors to enable the accuracy of satellite measurements is a precise evaluation of the wind speed within the L-band footprint and the stability of the instrument or calibration device. The instrument has to be calibrated to an accuracy of better than 0.2 K in terms of temporal variability. This level of precision is believed to be achievable, but does represent an implementation challenge. Extreme care has to be taken for the sensor design and development.</p>
