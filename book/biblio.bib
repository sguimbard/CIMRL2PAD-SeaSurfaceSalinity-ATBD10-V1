  Abstract                 = {The freshest surface waters in the tropical Pacific are found at its eastern boundary. Using in situ observations, we depict the quasi-permanent presence of a far eastern Pacific fresh pool with sea surface salinity (SSS) lower than 33, which is confined between Panama's west coast and 85\'eW in December and extends westward to 95\'eW in April. Strong SSS fronts are found at the outer edge of this fresh pool. We investigate the seasonal dynamics of the fresh pool using complementary satellite wind, rain, sea level and in situ oceanic current data at the surface, along with hydrographic profiles. The fresh pool appears off Panama due to the strong summer rains associated with the northward migration of the ITCZ over Central America in June. During the second half of the year, the eastward-flowing North Equatorial Counter-Current keeps it trapped to the coast and strengthens the SSS front on its western edge. During winter, as the ITCZ moves southward, the northeasterly Panama gap wind creates a southwestward jet-like current in its path with a dipole of Ekman pumping/eddies on its flanks. As a result, upwelling in the Panama Bight brings to the surface cold and salty waters which erode the fresh pool on its eastern side while both the jet current and the enhanced South Equatorial Current stretch the fresh pool westward until it nearly disappears in May. New SMOS satellite SSS data proves able to capture the main seasonal features of the fresh pool and monitor its spatial extent.},

  Abstract                 = {An empirical orthogonal function--based technique called Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) is used in a multivariate approach to reconstruct missing data. Sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll a concentration, and QuikSCAT winds are used to assess the benefit of a multivariate reconstruction. In particular, the combination of SST plus chlorophyll, SST plus lagged SST plus chlorophyll, and SST plus lagged winds have been studied. To assess the quality of the reconstructions, the reconstructed SST and winds have been compared to in situ data. The combination of SST plus chlorophyll, as well as SST plus lagged SST plus chlorophyll, significantly improves the results obtained by the reconstruction of SST alone. All the experiments correctly represent the SST, and an upwelling/downwelling event in the West Florida Shelf reproduced by the reconstructed data is studied.},

  abstract = {Upper ocean measurements of temperature and salinity obtained from profiling floats equipped with auxiliary Surface Temperature and Salinity sensors (STS) are presented. Using these instruments, high vertical resolution (10 cm) measurements in the near-surface layer were acquired to within 20 cm of the sea surface, allowing for an examination of the ocean's near-surface structure and variability not usually possible. We examine the data from sixty-two Argo-type floats equipped with STS units deployed in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. The vertical variability of temperature and salinity in the near-surface layer are characterized for each of these regions. While observations show the upper four meters of the ocean are well mixed most of the time, this homogeneity is interrupted by significant and often short-lived warming/cooling and freshening events. In addition to the presence of barrier layers, a strong diurnal signal in temperature is observed, with salinity exhibiting somewhat weaker diurnal variations. The magnitude of the upper ocean diurnal cycle in temperature and salinity is largest in areas with light winds and heavy precipitation and was found to decay rapidly with depth (50% over the top two meters). Storm events, validated from meteorological data collected from nearby TAO moorings and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, show downward mixing of rainfall-derived fresh water to ten meters depth over only a few hours. Turner angle calculations show strong instability following these events.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a systematic investigation of the applicability of a group of mixing rules for obtaining the dielectric constant (permittivity) of sea foam (whitecaps) at microwave frequencies, 1.4 to 37 GHz. By demonstrating that the foam scattering is weak at these frequencies, we justify our interest in basic mixing rules, which do not involve explicit scattering computation, namely, the Maxwell Garnett, Polder-Van Santen, Coherent potential, Looyenga, and Refractive models. The complex dielectric constant of sea foam obtained with these mixing rules is presented and the dependence of foam permittivity on foam void fraction, radiation frequency, sea surface temperature, and salinity is reported. With the exception of the Coherent potential model, all selected mixing rules give reasonable values for the sea foam dielectric constant. To further examine the suitability of a permittivity model for computing the dielectric constant of sea foam, the performance of each mixing rule is evaluated on the basis of three criteria: (1) how well a permittivity model deals with a wide range of void fractions, (2) how a permittivity model behaves approaching the foam-air and foam-water boundaries, and (3) how the choice of a permittivity model affects estimates of emissivity and brightness temperature due to foam. The suitability of the basic mixing rules for computing the complex dielectric constant of sea foam at microwave frequencies can be ranked as: (1) Refractive model, (2) Looyenga model, (3) Maxwell Garnett model, and (4) Polder-Van Santen model.},

  Abstract                 = {We present estimates of whitecap coverage on a global scale from satellite-measured brightness temperature of the ocean surface. This is a first step in a larger framework aiming at more realistic modeling of the high variability of whitecap coverage as a function of wind speed and a suite of additional environmental and meteorological factors. The involvement of oceanic whitecaps in various physical and chemical processes important for climate studies such as production of sea-salt aerosols, enhancement of air-sea gas exchange, and influence on retrievals of ocean surface wind and ocean color motivates this effort. A critical review of the physical variables causing the high variability of whitecap coverage and existing approaches modeling this variability establishes the need for a database of whitecap coverage and concomitant measurements of additional factors. The necessity to build such an extensive database justifies the quest for a method estimating whitecap coverage from satellite data. We describe the physical concept, a possible implementation, error analysis, results, and evaluation of a method for estimating whitecap coverage from routine satellite measurements. The advantages of the concept and the drawbacks and necessary improvements of the implementation are discussed.},

This paper is concerned with the reconstruction of radiometric brightness temperature maps from SAIR interferometric measurements. Even in the absence of modeling errors and radiometric noise, a systematic error, or bias, has been observed in the reconstructed maps. The origin of this bias is analyzed and an efficient solution is proposed for reducing it. The core reconstruction procedure is not changed, and no additional measurements are needed. Throughout the scientific rationale, particular emphasis is laid on numerical simulations carried out for the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity space mission, a project led by the European Space Agency and devoted to the remote sensing of soil moisture and ocean salinity from a low-orbit platform},

  Abstract                 = {The SMOS mission is a European Space Agency (ESA) project aimed at global monitoring of surface soil moisture and sea surface salinity from radiometric L-band observations. The radiometer onboard SMOS uses a 2-D synthetic aperture concept in order to achieve satisfactory spatial resolution performances for a minimal cost in terms of payload mass and volume. As the satellite moves ahead, every area on Earth's surface is seen at a variety of incidence angles. This multiangular capability is used in the retrieval of geophysical parameters. A major issue for obtaining useful measurements of the surface salinity is the radiometric accuracy, since the overall dynamic range resulting from ocean salinity variations only extends over a few Kelvin. To improve instrument performances, it is foreseen that independent retrieved salinity estimates will be averaged over a suitable space/time domain. This should bring random uncertainties due to radiometric sensitivity down to around 0.1 Practical Salinity Scale (PSS). However, several systematic error sources are also present: biases arise from channel or baseline instrument errors and are superimposed to Gibbs oscillations generated through the reconstruction of brightness temperature fields from correlation products. It is thus of importance to assess to which extent these errors can be averaged out when building space/time averages of the retrieved salinity values. The presents study is a step toward addressing this issue.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatially averaged (50$\,^{\circ}$S--65$\,^{\circ}$N) temperature and salinity changes in the 0--3000 m layer during the 1957--1994 period resulted in a sea level rise at a mean rate of about 0.55 mm per year. About 10% of this rate is due to a decrease of the volume mean salinity. The magnitude of total steric sea level (TSSL) changes and the ratio of thermosteric and halosteric anomalies to TSSL anomaly are nonuniform geographically. Salinity effects are critically important to the TSSL changes in some regions of the ocean. For example, the thermosteric anomaly is nearly compensated by the halosteric anomaly in the subpolar North Atlantic. This fact will cause erroneous heat content estimates based on altimetric observations from space if a climatological salinity is assumed. Based on the present historical archive of salinity data, a decrease in global mean salinity has occurred. This increase of fresh water would cause sea level rise at a rate of 1.3 $\pm$ 0.5 mm/yr if the added water comes from sources other than floating sea ice.},

It is pointed out that a family of schemes can conserve total energy for general flow and potential enstrophy for flow with no mass flux divergence. The newly derived scheme is a unique member of this family, that conserves both potential enstrophy and energy for general flow. Comparison by means of numerical experiment with a scheme that conserves (potential) enstrophy for purely horizontal nondivergent flow demonstrated the considerable superiority of the newly derived potential enstrophy and energy conserving scheme, not only in suppressing a spurious energy cascade but also in determining the overall flow regime. The potential enstrophy and energy conserving scheme for a spherical grid is also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The behavior of the intense anticyclonic eddy observed during the Tourbillon Experiment (September-November 1979) is studied within the framework of quasi-geostrophic dynamics. The nondivergent part of the pressure held is estimated through objective analysis at the times of four quasi-synoptic CTD arrays, making use as well of velocity data from the current-meter mooring array and subsurface acoustic floats. Maps of relative vorticity, vortex stretching and potential vorticity allow identification of the signature of the eddy. Nearby companion anomalies caused by an intrusion of Mediterranean Water (MW) can be singled out and are comparable to those of the main eddy around 1200 m. Eulerian and Lagrangian tests of the conservation of potential vorticity are presented and the close similarities of salinity and potential vorticity as tracers of mesoscale motions are vividly demonstrated. Computations of advection of vortex stretching and relative vorticity show that the anticyclonic path of the main eddy above 1000 m is controlled by a genuine interaction with the MW intrusion whose ultimate cited is to sheer the vertical axis of the eddy. It is argued that such interactions must be rather common in the eastern North Atlantic for warm salty patches of Mediterranean origin are often associated with low density anomalies.},

These data are characterized by high resolution, coverage, and accuracy, but their application has been limited by the lack of directional information. In an effort to extend the applicability of these data, methodology has been developed to assign directions to the SSM/I wind speeds and to produce analyses using these data. Following extensive testing, this methodology has been used to generate a seven and one-half year dataset (from July 1987 through December 1994) of global SSM/I wind vectors. These data are currently being used in a variety of atmospheric and oceanic applications and are available to interested investigators. Recent results presented in this paper show the accuracy of the SSM/I wind velocities, the ability of these data to improve surface wind analyses, and the propagation of a synoptic-scale convergent vortex in the Tropics that can be tracked from year to year in annual mean SSM/I wind fields.},

  Abstract                 = {During the Atlantic Expedition 1965 and the Atlantic Tradewind Experiment (ATEX) 1969, shipborne aerological measurements were obtained in order to investigate the thermodynamical and kinematic structure of the planetary boundary layer in low latitudes. Under suppressed convection, the subdivision of this layer into five sub-regions was found to be a rather permanent feature. Enhanced cumulus convection effects a smoothing of the thermodynamical discontinuities and leads sometimes to a destruction of the trade inversion. Due to the surface pressure distribution and the thermal wind distribution in the lower atmosphere, the actual wind speed and direction are nearly constant with height below cloud base. In the cloud layer up to the inversion, the wind speed generally decreases and the air flow tends to become more zonal.},

Applied to sea surface temperature (SST), we propose a method for the characterization of this geometric regularity from curvature-based statistics along temperature level lines in front regions. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed descriptors, we used six years (from 2003 to 2008) of daily SST observations of the regions of Agulhas in the South of Africa and of Malvinas off the southern Brazilian coast. These experiments stress the relevance of geometric regularity features of tracer observation at ocean surface to characterize seasonal variations in ocean regimes.},

They are compared with earlier solutions based on a combination of perturbation theory which accounts for Bragg scattering, and physical optics which accounts for specular point theory. The full wave solutions which account for both Bragg scattering and specular point scattering in a self-consistent manner are expressed as a weighted sum of two cross sections. The first is associated with a filtered surface, consisting of the larger scale spectral components, and the second is associated with the surface consisting of the smaller scale spectral components. The specification of the surface wavenumber that separates the surface with the larger spectral components from the surface with the smaller spectral components is dealt with in detail. Since the full wave approach is not restricted by the limitations of perturbation theory, it is possible to examine the sensitivity of the computed values for the backscatter cross sections to large variations in the value of the wavenumber where spectral splitting is assumed to occur.},

  Abstract                 = {Perturbation and physical optics theories have traditionally been used to derive the scattering cross sections for composite surfaces that can be regarded as small-scale surface perturbations that ride on filtered, large-scale surfaces. In this case, perturbation theory accounts for Bragg scattering, while physical optics theory accounts for specular point scattering. However, for a more general class of composite surfaces that cannot be decomposed in such a manner, the perturbated physical optics approach cannot be used. In these cases, it is shown, using the full wave approach, that the specular scattering associated with a filtered surface (consisting of the larger-scale spectral components) is strongly modified and that Bragg scattering and specular point scattering begin to blend with each other. Since the full wave solution accounts for Bragg scattering as well as specular point scattering in a self-consistent manner, it is not necessary to filter (decompose) the composite surface to evaluate the scattering cross sections in the general case. However, filtering the composite surface enhances one's physical insight as to the validity (or lack thereof) of the perturbated physical optics decomposition and also facilitates the numerical evaluation of the scattering cross sections.},

  Abstract                 = {No single scattering theory can be used to evaluate the scatter cross sections of surfaces with multiple scales of roughness. In this paper a two-scale unified full-wave approach is used to evaluate the backscatter cross sections for vertically and horizontally polarized waves. The total cross sections are expressed analytically as weighted sums of a tilt-modulated smaller-scale surface height backscatter cross section and a larger-scale surface physical optics backscatter cross section, reduced by the square of the smaller-scale surface characteristic function. Consistent with the large radii of curvature criteria, only the slopes of the larger-scale surface contribute to tilt modulation. Unlike the conventional hybrid perturbation/physical optics solutions, the unified full-wave approach used here is not restricted to small Rayleigh roughness parameters. The total surface is decomposed continuously and smoothly into smaller- and larger-scale surfaces. It is shown that the total backscatter cross sections are stationary over a very broad range of the variational parameters, proportional to the ratio of the mean square slopes or heights of the larger-scale surface and the total surface. At grazing angles of incidence, the vertically and horizontally polarized cross sections are shown to be of the same order of magnitude, consistent with recent experimental data. This is because at grazing angles, tilt modulation impacts significantly on the horizontally polarized cross sections and marginally upon the vertically polarized cross sections. This is consistent with the observation that the original full-wave solutions (that do not account for tilt modulation) underestimate the values for the horizontally polarized cross sections. These investigations also impact on the feasibility of relating the backscatter cross sections to the remote sensing of soil moisture content.},

Real or synthetic aperture radars (SARs) with small effective footprints (resolution cells) are considered. Since the unified full-wave approach accounts for Bragg scattering as well as specular point scattering in a self-consistent manner, it is not necessary to adopt a two-scale model for the rough sea surface. The sea surface slope probability density function is assumed to be Gaussian. The backscattering cross sections are evaluated for all angles of incidence (normal to grazing). For tilts in the plane of incidence, the modulation of all the cross sections is largest at angles of incidence of 10 deg;. The cross-section modulation due to tilts perpendicular to the plane of incidence critically depends on the incident and scattered polarizations. The effective filtering of the large-scale spectral components of the rough sea surface by the high-resolution radar is accounted for, and the dependence of the cross-section tilt modulation on the size of the effective footprint is determined},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes an experimental investigation in which a large number of water waves were focused at one point in space and time to produce a large transient wave group. Measurements of the water surface elevation and the underlying kinematics are compared with both a linear wave theory and a second-order solution based on the sum of the wave-wave interactions identified by Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1960). The data shows that the focusing of wave components produces a highly nonlinear wave group in which the nonlinearity increases with the wave amplitude and reduces with increasing bandwidth. When compared with the first- and second-order solutions, the wave-wave interactions produce a steeper wave envelope in which the central wave crest is higher and narrower, while the adjacent wave troughs are broader and less deep. The water particle kinematics are also strongly nonlinear. The accumulated experimental data suggest that the formation of a focused wave group involves a significant transfer of energy into both the higher and lower harmonics. This is consistent with an increase in the local energy density, and the development of large velocity gradients near the water surface. Furthermore, the nonlinear wave-wave interactions are shown to be fully reversible. However, when compared to a linear solution there is a permanent change in the relative phase of the free waves. This explains the downstream shifting of the focus point (Longuet-Higgins 1974), and appears to be similar to the phase changes which result from the nonlinear interaction of solitons travelling at different velocities (Yuen & Lake 1982).},

  abstract = {This paper provides an assessment of synoptic measurements of sea surface salinity (SSS) from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. Due to the complex nature of the response of L-band signals to SSS, SMOS provides three values of SSS at each grid point from three different forward models. To meet oceanographic requirements for SSS retrieval accuracy, SMOS Level 2 SSS products are averaged over time and space. This paper reports on validation studies in the Atlantic based on monthly Level 3 products on a $1^{circ}times 1^{circ}$ grid for September 2010. Outside coastal regions, large-scale SSS patterns from SMOS are in general agreement with climatology, Argo, and ocean model output. During September 2010, SSS from descending passes provides reasonable quantitative estimates, while SSS from ascending passes overestimates SSS by over 1 practical salinity unit (psu). The daily mean difference in SSS between ascending and descending passes varies during August #x2013;December 2010, reaching a maximum in September. Differences in SMOS SSS from the three models are an order of magnitude smaller than differences between ascending and descending passes. Gridded SMOS SSS data are compared against output from the U.K. Met Office Forecasting Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM)-Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO). Basic checks confirm that SSS from FOAM-NEMO is unbiased against Argo and that FOAM-NEMO SSS is a useful independent data source to validate and rapidly identify departures in SMOS SSS. Over the whole Atlantic, SMOS SSS variability against FOAM-NEMO is around 0.9 psu, decreasing to 0.5 psu over the subtropical North Atlantic.},

  abstract = {Equilibrium spectral behavior for ocean gravity wind waves has been investigated actively over the past three decades, yet fundamental problems remain in reconciling theory with observations. Predicted equilibrium spectral forms from physical models proposed recently by Kitaigorodskii and by Phillips are examined in the light of wavenumber and frequency spectra reported by several investigators. While frequency domain observations appear to support the model predictions, observed wavenumber spectra are found to differ both in the spectral dependence on wavenumber and on the wind speed. Based on observed wavenumber and frequency spectra for fetch-limited condition a model is proposed for the form of the directional wavenumber spectrum slice in the dominant wave direction. Reduced wavenumber and frequency spectra are calculated from this model, assuming an empirical spectral directional spreading function and the linear gravity wave dispersion relation. These calculations reveal the underlying influences which shape these reduced spectra. In the energy containing subrange, just above the spectral peak, the dominant influence shaping these spectra is the variation of the directional spreading function with distance from the spectral peak. For frequency spectra, at higher frequencies, the model calculations predict that the range of observed frequency spectral dependences is due primarily to the Doppler shifting from advection of the shorter waves by the orbital motion of the dominant waves, with possible additional influences of wind drift and ambient currents. Combining these results, composite calculated frequency spectra and one-dimensional wavenumber spectra show close correspondence with measured field spectra. In addition to clarifying the key processes that shape different regimes in the frequency spectrum, a refinement of the bounds of the gravity equilibrium subrange is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent numerical model studies of nonlinear deep water wave group evolution suggest that wave breaking onset is associated primarily with a threshold behavior linked to the nonlinear wave group hydrodynamics. Motivated by these findings, a recently published probability analysis of observed dominant ocean wind wave breaking events reported a threshold behavior using the significant wave steepness as a measure of the mean nonlinearity of these waves. The present study investigates whether a similar threshold dependence in terms of an appropriate spectral measure of wave steepness, the spectral saturation, may be found for the breaking probability of shorter wind waves above the spectral peak. Extensive data records of open ocean whitecap breaking wave occurrences for wind speeds up to 18 m sâ1 were analyzed for breaking probability dependence on spectral saturation in spectral bands with center frequencies ranging from 1 to 2.48 times the spectral peak frequency. Results are based on the measured ratio of passage rates past a fixed point of breaking crests to total crests for different wave scales. An extension of the zero-crossing method for counting wave crests was developed. Using this method the authors found that in any spectral subrange within the observed range of frequencies, a strong correlation exists between breaking probability and an appropriate mean spectral steepness parameter and that this correlation is characterized by a robust threshold behavior, just as was reported previously for the spectral peak waves. Further, to offset the influence of increasing directional spreading of the waves above the spectral peak frequency, an empirical directional spreading function was used to normalize the azimuth-integrated spectral saturation. Under this normalization, the spectral saturation threshold for breaking onset appears to have a common level over the frequency range investigated. This study also examined the correlation of breaking probability with spectral peak wave age. The low correlation found for all spectral ranges investigated suggests that nonlinear wave hydrodynamics are more important than wind forcing for the breaking of these wind waves.},

  abstract = {A theoretical analysis of the angular resolution of two-dimensional interferometric radiometers for Earth observation from low-orbit satellites and its degradation due to spatial decorrelation effects is presented. The analysis extends basic effects known in the context of radio astronomy (application with narrow field of view, very few baselines) and in one dimension (ESTAR L band, few baselines interferometric radiometer) to the wide-field-of-view, many-baseline, high-resolution two-dimensional system required by Earth observation applications and computes beam width, encircled energy (or main beam efficiency), and side lobe level as a function of windowing (apodization) to allow for an optimum angular versus radiometric resolution trade-off. It is found that the extension of the Barlett window (which has a poor performance in one dimensional signal processing) to two dimensions produces high-quality results, comparable or better than those of Gaussian and Blackmann windows. Theory is extended to hexagonally sampled systems based on a Y-shaped instrument, with hexagonal- and star-shaped support regions in the visibility space, respectively. The superior performance of the latter over the former for the same number of antennas and correlators is quantified and details of the angular resolution of one instrument of this kind, MIRAS, under development by the European Space Agency, are presented. For this radiometer Gaussian or Barlett windows should be used for good radiometric sensitivity or spatial resolution, respectively. In both cases the effects of decorrelation within the small alias-free field of view are negligible. It is also found that the impact of hardware imperfections which exist within the strict requirements of the specifications have a negligible effect on the angular resolution. Finally, experimental angular resolution results with a laboratory breadboard in a focused near-field setup are presented and compared to the theoretical predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {In a previous paper (Weber and Barrick, 1977), a generalization of Stokesâ perturbational technique permitted us to obtain solutions to higher orders for gravity-wave parameters for an arbitrary, two-dimensional periodic surface. In particular, the second-order wave-height correction and the third-order dispersion relation correction were derived there. In this paper, we interpret and apply those solutions in a variety of ways. First of all, we interpret the dispersion relation (and its higher order corrections) physically, as they relate to the phase velocity of individual ocean wave trains. Second, the validity of the two results derived previously is established by comparisons in the appropriate limiting cases with classical results available from the literature. It is shown how the solutionsâderived for periodic surface profilesâcan be generalized to include random wave fields whose average properties are to be specified. Then a number of examples of averaged higher order wave parameters, are given, and in certain cases a Phillipsâ one-dimensional wave-height spectral model is employed to yield a quantitative feel for the magnitudes of these higher order effects. Both the derivations and the examples have direct application to the sea echo observed with high-frequency radars, and relationships with the radar observables are established and discussed.},

Furthermore, experiments have shown that any currents present near the surface produce a readily distinguishable Doppler shift on the wave-scattered echo which is directly related to the current velocity.},

  Abstract                 = {One method of analyzing radiation and propagation above a surface is to employ an effective surface impedance to describe the effect of the boundary. In this paper an expression is derived for the effective impedance at grazing incidence of a slightly rough interface between air and a finitely conducting medium for which the Leontovich boundary condition is applicable. The perturbation technique of Rayleigh and Rice is employed, and attention is restricted to vertical polarization. The resulting effective surface impedance consists of two terms, the impedance of the lower medium when the surface is perfectly smooth and a term accounting for roughness. The latter term can be complex in general and depends on the strengths of the roughness spectral components present. The result is applicable to either deterministic periodic surfaces or random rough surfaces. Various alternate definitions of the effective surface impedance are examined and are seen to be equivalent. The analysis of power flow at the surface permits the interpretation of the interaction process in terms of scattered fields.},

For this estimation, an expression is employed that was derived in part 1; it gives the effective surface impedance in terms of the spatial height spectrum of the surface. Two empirical models are employed for the height spectrum of the ocean, the directional Neumann-Pierson model and the isotropic Phillips wind-wave model. These effective surface impedances accounting for sea state are then inserted into a standard ESSA computer program giving the basic transmission loss above a spherical earth. The dependence on sea state is plotted in curves which show the excess loss in decibels over a smooth sea. The propagation loss to points at various heights above the sea is also calculated. Normal sea state variations are seen to be negligible below about 2 MHz but produce a maximum excess loss at about 10 to 15 MHz.},

  abstract = {Experiments on the scattering of radio waves in the range 200 m to 3 cm from a rough sea surface are described. Amplitude, frequency, and space-time characteristics of scattered radio signals at different states of the sea surface are presented. It is shown that the problem of the short and medium wave scattering from the sea can be solved by the perturbance method. In this case the mechanism of scattering is of "resonant" character. The intensity of the backscatter signals is proportional to the density of the spatial spectrum on the half-length of the radio waves. The high frequency radio wave scattering is well described by a two-scale model of the scattering surface, "ripple on the large wave." The intensity of scattered radio signals is also proportional to the spectrum density of "ripples" whose length is approximately equal to half a radio wave. The effect of the large waves is to modulate the amplitude of a scattered radio signal and to broaden its frequency spectrum. Methods of solution of the reverse problem were considered. This allowed determination of parameters of sea roughness by characteristics of scattered radio signals. The principles of design of the corresponding equipment are described.},

  Abstract                 = {The ocean wave model WAM was recently upgraded to improve the coupling between the sea state and the air flow and, in particular, enhance the growth of young wind sea over that of old wind sea. Prior to this change, numerous validations of the original wind input physics by the wave modeling community had shown a consistent underprediction of wave heights in the Southern Hemisphere. Preliminary tests of the upgraded version indicated that the change in physics improved wave height predictions but did not completely eliminate the bias. To specifically test the upgraded version, a one-month hindcast study for the Australian region was conducted using both the improved and the original physics. The hindcast significant wave heights were compared against observations from three locations wound the Australian coast and were found to he overpredicted by the upgraded physics and underpredicted by the original physics. A series of experiments were then made that indicated the upgraded physics were sensitive to conditions unique to the Southern Ocean, that is, long stretches of open water and a continuous procession of strong frontal systems migrating from west to east. In particular. it is found that as part of the upgraded physics the modification to the dissipation term resulted in an excessive transfer of energy to the low frequencies by means of the nonlinear interaction term. Consequently, the wave energy continues to grow, resulting in excessive wave heights. While the use of the original physics has led to underpredicted wave heights in the past, the author shows that this bias can be reduced by improving the present first-order upwinding propagation numerics to third order. This dramatically reduces the numerical diffusion that causes excessive dissipation of swell travelling the long distances typical in the Southern Ocean. The author then reconducted the one-month hindcast study using the original physics and third-order upwinding nunneries and showed that wave height predictions are improved.},

The hypothesis asserts that outside and on the obstacle the scattered field may be expanded in terms of outward-going wave functions of the circular cylinder. As such, it is analogous to the assumption made by Lord Rayleigh in his treatment of diffraction by a reflection grating. We show that the validity of the Rayleigh hypothesis is governed by the distribution of singularities in the analytic continuation of the exterior scattered field. Conditions are derived under which the Rayleigh hypothesis is rigorously valid. As examples, the elliptic cylinder and the perturbed circular cylinder are considered in detail.},

  Abstract                 = {Series of sensitivity tests were performed with a z-coordinate, global eddy-permitting (1/4{\textdegree}) ocean/sea-ice model (the ORCA-R025 model configuration developed for the DRAKKAR project) to carefully evaluate the impact of recent state-of-the-art numerical schemes on model solutions. The combination of an energy--enstrophy conserving (EEN) scheme for momentum advection with a partial step (PS) representation of the bottom topography yields significant improvements in the mean circulation. Well known biases in the representation of western boundary currents, such as in the Atlantic the detachment of the Gulf Stream, the path of the North Atlantic Current, the location of the Confluence, and the strength of the Zapiola Eddy in the south Atlantic, are partly corrected. Similar improvements are found in the Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans, and characteristics of the mean flow are generally much closer to observations. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art models show that the ORCA-R025 configuration generally performs better at similar resolution. In addition, the model solution is often comparable to solutions obtained at 1/6 or 1/10{\textdegree} resolution in some aspects concerning mean flow patterns and distribution of eddy kinetic energy. Although the reasons for these improvements are not analyzed in detail in this paper, evidence is shown that the combination of EEN with PS reduces numerical noise near the bottom, which is likely to affect current--topography interactions in a systematic way. We conclude that significant corrections of the mean biases presently seen in general circulation model solutions at eddy-permitting resolution can still be expected from the development of numerical methods, which represent an alternative to increasing resolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-river delta-front estuaries (LDE) are important interfaces between continents and the oceans for material fluxes that have a global impact on marine biogeochemistry. In this article, we propose that more emphasis should be placed on LDE in future global climate change research. We will use some of the most anthropogenically altered LDE systems in the world, the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River and the Chinese rivers that enter the Yellow Sea (e.g., Huanghe and Changjiang) as case-studies, to posit that these systems are both âdriversâ and ârecordersâ of natural and anthropogenic environmental change. Specifically, the processes in the LDE can influence (âdriveâ) the flux of particulate and dissolved materials from the continents to the global ocean that can have profound impact on issues such as coastal eutrophication and the development of hypoxic zones. LDE also record in their rapidly accumulating subaerial and subaqueous deltaic sediment deposits environmental changes such as continental-scale trends in climate and land-use in watersheds, frequency and magnitude of cyclonic storms, and sea-level change. The processes that control the transport and transformation of carbon in the active LDE and in the deltaic sediment deposit are also essential to our understanding of carbon sequestration and exchange with the world oceanâan important objective in global change research. U.S. efforts in global change science including the vital role of deltaic systems are emphasized in the North American Carbon Plan (www.carboncyclescience.gov).},

  Abstract                 = {We have examined historical distributions of sea surface salinity (SSS) observations in a data set consisting of a combination of the World Ocean Database 1998 (WOD98) and a thermosalinograph and bucket salinity database collected from volunteer observing ships. It is well known that SSS in much of the world's ocean is measured infrequently or not at all. We find that 27% of one-degree squares in the world ocean (open and coastal, excluding the Arctic Ocean) had no observations of SSS in the historical database, and 70% had 10 or fewer. Systematic sampling of SSS (more than 10,000 observations per year globally) did not start until after 1960. Most SSS observations in the WOD98 are concentrated in the North Sea and coast of northern Europe, the east and west coasts of North America, and around Japan. About 28% of SSS measurements are in coastal waters. We plotted frequency histograms of SSS for some selected well-sampled one-degree squares in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific. We found most frequency histograms to be non-Gaussian. The main departure from normal distribution is due to anomalous low-salinity measurements creating a negative skewness. This conclusion is verified as a global phenomenon by examining statistics of mean-median SSS difference within one-degree squares. This quantity is found to be predominantly negative over the global ocean. These anomalous low-salinity values may be due to rainfall events, but there are other plausible physical mechanisms, like frontal movement and eddy activity. There were also areas where the distributions were bimodal due to the presence of meandering fronts with little cross-frontal mixing. Examples are shown where the non-Gaussian nature of the distributions in the areas examined is both a short-term and a long-term phenomenon. That is, the distributions are skewed on a nearly instantaneous (â¼1 month) basis and averaged over long time periods (1 + years). This has important implications for climatologies because the differences between mean and modal SSS, for the analyzed one-degree squares, is of order 0.1. Furthermore, the implication for validation studies for remote sensing missions is that the studies must make enough measurements of SSS to determine the extent to which the probability density is not Gaussian.},

  abstract = {Abstract The embedment of a 1.5 turbulence closure model in an ocean general circulation model of the equatorial Atlantic is presented. The eddy viscosity and diffusivity involved in the vertical mixing are defined as the product of a characteristic turbulent velocityâthe root square of the turbulent kinetic energyâand a characteristic mixing length. The turbulent kinetic energy is defined through a prognostic equation while the turbulent length scales are defined by a diagnostic formulation. The results of an experiment that includes this closure scheme are compared to the results issued from another experiment that includes a Richardson number-dependent parameterization of the mixing coefficients. The two simulations were performed over the tropical Atlantic during the 1982â1984 period, which allows direct comparisons with data from the FOCAL and SEQUAL experiments. Obvious contrasts between the two experiments on the sea surface temperature and on the dynamics indicate that the turbulent vertical diffusion plays a major role in the surface processes simulated by the model. Comparisons with available observations show that the introduction of the 1.5 closure scheme improves the ability of the general circulation model to represent the sea surface temperature, the vertical mixed-layer structure, the equatorial meridional circulation cell, as well as the equatorial undercurrent, which becomes more energetic. Despite strong assumptions in the turbulent vertical mixing scheme, the turbulent fields provided by the turbulent kinetic parameterization allow a comparison with direct measurements of turbulence performed in the tropical oceans and highlight the complex behavior of turbulent mixing in the ocean.},

  Abstract                 = {A newly developed hybrid-coordinate ocean circulation model is documented and tested. Coordinate surfaces in this model adhere to isopycnals wherever this does not violate minimum layer thickness requirements; elsewhere, coordinate surfaces are geometrically constrained. The intent of this approach, some of whose features are reminiscent of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique, is to combine the best features of isopycnic-coordinate and fixed-grid circulation models within a single framework. The hybrid model is an offshoot of the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model whose solutions, obtained under identical geographic and forcing conditions, serve as reference. Century-scale simulations on a coarse-mesh near-global domain show considerable similarities in the modeled thermohaline-forced circulation. Certain architectural details, such as the choice of prognostic thermodynamic variables (Ï,S versus T,S) and the algorithm for moving coordinate surfaces toward their reference isopycnals, are found to only have a minor impact on the solution. Emphasis in this article is on the numerical resiliency of the hybrid coordinate approach. Exploitation of the model's flexible coordinate layout in areas of ocean physics where pure isopycnic coordinate models only have limited options, such as mixed-layer turbulence parameterization, will be the subject of forthcoming articles.},

  Abstract                 = {Airborne microwave radiometer measurements over mineral and monomolecular oil films and adjacent clean sea surfaces are reported. An artificial crude-oil spill experiment in the New York Bight area showed a brightness temperature increase of the sea surface at 1.43 GHz as expected from a multilayered system with different dielectric constants. However, a monomolecular surface-film experiment with oleyl alcohol conducted in the North Sea during MARSEN in 1979 showed a strong brightness temperature depression at 1.43 GHz and no change in brightness temperature at 2.65 GHz. It is postulated that the monomolecular layer, because of its physical and chemical properties, polarized the underlying water molecules so strongly that the emissivity decreased from 0.31 to 0.016. It is estimated that the effective dielectric constant changed from 90 to 5.2 104. Because these phenomena occurred at 1.43 GHz it may be concluded that this frequency is very close to the center of a new anomalous dispersion region resulting from a restructuring of the water layer below the surface film.},

A multifrequency radiometer system which earlier demonstrated an accuracy of 1Â°C and lâ° in remotely detecting the surface temperature and salinities, respectively, was used to detect submarine freshwater springs. The first mission on February 4, 1978, consisted of overflight measurements over three fourths of the coastal areas around the island of Puerto Rico. During the second mission on February 6, 1978, special attention was directed to the northwest portion of Puerto Rico where several submarine springs had been reported. The previously reported spring locations correlated well with the locations detected by the radiometers. After separating the surface runoffs such as rivers, lagoons, marshes, and bays, 44 submarine freshwater springs were identified which indicates that the submarine freshwater outflow locations are more numerous around the island than had earlier been estimated. The majority of the submarine springs are located at the northwest and southeast portion of the Puerto Rican coastline. The success of detecting the same submarine springs during both missions at the northwest portion of the island was 39%.},

  Abstract                 = {Laboratory studies have been conducted in two circular wind wave flumes to investigate the relationship between air-sea transfer velocities of weakly soluble, nonreactive gases and wind-generated surface waves over clean water surfaces and in the presence of surface films. Detailed surface wave measurements have been made using a scanning laser slope gauge. In the circular tanks, longer gravity waves (wavenumber below 12 rad/m) are hardly affected by surfactant, while shorter waves (above 100 rad/m) are significantly reduced. With higher surfactant concentrations, waves above 200â300 rad/m may be completely eliminated. Because of the absence of narrow-banded fetch-limited gravity waves, the wave fields in the circular tanks are significantly different from those in linear wind wave flumes. At a given wind friction velocity, the transfer velocity may decrease by as much as 60% because of surface films. Regardless of the surfactant concentrations, the transfer velocity shows a reasonable correlation with the total mean square slope and with the mean square slope of shorter wind waves (wavenumber above 200 rad/m). However, it shows a poor correlation with the mean square slope of longer wind waves (wavenumber below 50 rad/m). These observations suggest that short wind waves play an important role in air-sea gas exchange.},

This identity requires full scattering information for all frequencies and aspect angles. An integral equation for incomplete scattering information for this identity is developed. This integral equation is for the unknown characteristic function of the scatterer in terms of the known incomplete scattering information. The kernel of this integral equation is the three-dimensional spatial Fourier transform of the known characteristic function of the scattering information aperture. A regularized analytic closed-form solution to this integral equation is obtained. Synthesized numerico-experimental results verifying this solution are presented. The details of some special cases, consisting of a priori knowledge about the scatterer or the scattering information aperture, are presented.},

  abstract = {A diagnostic model of the tropical circulation over the 0-30-m layer is derived by using quasi-linear and steady physics. The horizontal velocity is directly estimated from sea surface height (TOPEX/Poseidon), surface vector wind (SSM/I) and sea surface temperature (AVHRR + in situ measurements). The absolute velocity is completed using the mean dynamic height inferred from the World Ocean Atlas (WOA). The central issue investigated in this study is the more accurate estimate of equatorial surface currents relative to prior satellite-derived method. The model formulation combines geostrophic, Ekman, and Stommel shear dynamics, and a complementary term from surface buoyancy gradient. The field is compared with velocity observations from 15-m-depth buoy drifter and equatorial Tropical Ocean-Atmosphere (TAO) current meters. Correlations with TAO data on the equator are much higher in the eastern Pacific cold tongue than before. The mean field in the cold tongue is also much more accurate, now showing the equatorial minimum that splits the South Equatorial Current into northern and southern branches. The mean current strength is somewhat less than in drifter composites because the mean dynamic topography from WOA remains too smooth. However, the seasonal cycle and interannual variations are robust, especially anomalies on the order of 1 m sâ1 during the 1997-98 ENSO. This direct method using satellite measurements provides surface current analyses for numerous research and operational applications.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple linear empirical model has been developed to allow the user of SEASAT altimetry data to correct the altitude measurements for sea state bias effects. This bias is the result of two separate effects: one relating to instrumental effects and the other relating to a bias in the electromagnetic mean sea level relative to the geometric mean sea level. The electromagnetic bias is caused by the fact that the troughs of the ocean waves reflect the altimeter signal more strongly than the crests, thus causing the altimeter-determined mean sea level to shift toward the wave troughs. An additional, but independent, instrument-related bias is introduced because height corrections applied in the ground processor are not sufficient to compensate for simplifying assumptions made for the processor aboard SEASAT. This altitude bias also is predominately wave height dependent and directed toward the wave trough. The sum of these two effects is referred to as sea state bias. After applying appropriate corrections to the altimetry data, an empirical model for the sea state bias is obtained by differencing significant wave height and height measurements from coincident ground tracks. Ignoring small temporal variations in surface topography, the height differences on a given track should be zero; consequently, any residual height difference is attributed to sea state bias. The height differences are minimized by solving for the coefficient of a linear relationship between height differences and wave height differences that minimize the height differences. It is concluded that, for the altimeter data released by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 7{\%} of the value of significant wave height should be subtracted from the SEASAT height measurements to correct for sea state bias. This correction reduced biases in the SEASAT data by more than 50{\%} in the 36 cases examined here.},

It will be demonstrated that a real aperture radiometer array can be understood as a synthetic aperture one, with a high level of redundancy. Therefore, all the recent results from synthetic aperture radiometry can be translated to real aperture radiometer arrays. This fact can be used to create beamforming arrays in a new way. To do this, the beamforming array equation will be written in terms of cross-correlations between all pair of antenna signals (visibility samples). By properly combining the visibility samples, a new type of digital beamforming radiometer can be implemented, which will benefit from the high calibration accuracy achieved in synthetic aperture radiometers (e.g., The Y-shaped MIRAS radiometer used in the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission of the European Space Agency) and the flexibility to electronically steer the beam.},

  abstract = {Spaceborne microwave remote sensing allows the determination of oceanic and atmospheric parameters. Operational payloads such as ERS-1 and ERS-2 and TOPEX/Poseidon as well as missions such as Jason (from NASA-Centre National d'Etudes) or Envisat (from the European Space Agency), have contained or contain paired microwave instruments looking at the nadir direction. This combination consists of microwave radiometers and a radar-altimeter. For the frequencies chosen in oceanographic satellite payloads, the active mode signal is mostly dependent on the surface state through its reflectivity and thus used for the near-surface wind speed retrieval. The active mode can also be attenuated by the atmosphere. On the other hand, the passive mode is related to the surface emissivity and the atmospheric radiation through the radiative transfer equation. Until now, the oceanic and atmospheric parameters have been retrieved separately, the latter being used to correct radar measurements. However, the reflectivity and the emissivity of a target are not independent quantities; hence the synergistic use of these two kinds of microwave measurements should allow one to improve the retrieval quality of the sea and atmosphere parameters. For this purpose, a unified model has been developed for the simulation of both the microwave backscattering coefficient ÏÂ° (active measurement) and the microwave emissivity, an important factor for the brightness temperature TB simulation, for every configuration (incidence angles, frequency, polarizations), taking into account the fact that the reflectivity and the emissivity are complementary to unity. The atmospheric absorption is computed following a widely used model from the literature. This paper gives a description and a first attempt of validation of this approach through a comparison with real data. The performance of the model is assessed by comparing the simulations to both brightness temperatures and backscattering coefficients from ERS-1 and TOPEX/Poseidon's instruments during the SEMAPHORE experiment, over a two-month period.},

  Abstract                 = {This study introduces a variational approach to retrieve total precipitable water (TPW) over all surface backgrounds including ocean, land, snow, <span class='snippet'>sea</span>-ice, and coastal areas, from microwave sensors. The product has been used routinely by forecasters since its recent operational implementation. The emissivity is accounted for by including its spectrum within the retrieved state vector, which allows for a pixel-to-pixel variation of the emissivity, a factor usually preventing the TPW retrieval over land. The algorithm, implemented operationally at the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA), is called the Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MiRS). Its main characteristic, besides its applicability over all surfaces, is its validity under all weather conditions. With a generic design, the algorithm is being applied to the following microwave sensors: (1) AMSU and MHS onboard NOAA-18; (2) NOAA-19 and Metop-A; as well as (3) SSMI/S onboard DMSP-F16 platform. The assessment of the MiRS performances is done by undertaking extensive comparisons to the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses, to a network of radiosondes and to existing well-established algorithms over ocean, encompassing a wide variety of meteorological situations. The performance of MiRS TPW is shown to depend on the sensor, the reference data source as well as on the surface background considered. It is shown to behave quite well over all surfaces and in all weather conditions, except when there is rain. Although this study focuses on the retrieval of TPW with an emphasis on non-oceanic surfaces, the underlying application of this study is the potential improvement in the variational data assimilation of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. Indeed, the same dynamic approach could be employed in order to assimilate more surface-sensitive microwave channels, over a multitude of surfaces.},

  abstract = {The spatial autocorrelation function of the heights of sea is pertinent information necessary to determine the electromagnetic scattering from a sea surface (Kirchhoff's model and shadowing function). In the literature the autocorrelation function is classically set anisotropic gaussian or anisotropic exponential. In this paper, the authors present the modelisation of the autocorrelation function, calculated for two bidimensional spectral configurations of the sea. The Apel spectrum is based on recent works. The Pierson spectrum added to its angular function, was developed in the 70s, and is still the most widely used the most at this moment. The determination of the autocorrelation function requires two integrations. The first angular integration is analytical, whereas the second over the wave number is numerical. In this lies calculating the originality of the authors' method. Calculating the analytical integration (instead of using a FFT inverse) allows the authors to find directly the behaviour of the autocorrelation function according to the viewing direction},

Using one year of ARGO measurements,we show that the surface salinity variability at ten days and 200-km scales is above Â±0.1 psu for 30% of the drifters and that this variability is larger than 0.2 psu in tropical regions affected by strong river discharges and by precipitations, and in frontal areas characterized by strong mesoscale activity. Vertical gradient observed between 5-10-m depth is much lower than the horizontal variability but leads to systematic biases in the tropics. The South Pacific Ocean appears to be the less variable both vertically and horizontally.},

The resulting estimated S1cm decrease associated with rainfall occurring within less than 1hour from the salinity measurement is close to -0.2 pss (mm hr-1)-1. We estimate that rain induced roughness and atmospheric effects are responsible for no more than 20% of this value. We also study the signature of rainfall on sea surface salinity measured by surface drifters at 45cm depth and find a decrease associated with rainfall of -0.21 (+/-0.14) pss (mm hr-1)-1, consistent with SMOS observations.When averaged over one month, this rain associated salinity decrease is at most -0.2 in monthly 100x100km2 pixels, and at most 40% of the difference between SMOS S1cm and interpolated in situ bulk salinity in pixels near the ITCZ. This suggests that more than half of this difference is related to the in-situ products obtained from optimal interpolation and therefore influenced by smoothing and relaxation to climatology. Finally, further studies on the satellite-derived salinities should pay attention to that as well as to other sources of uncertainties in satellite measurements and not interpret fully the observed differences between in situ and satellite mapped products, as rain induced SSS variability.},

  Abstract                 = {We validate Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieved during August 2010 from the European Space Agency SMOS processing. Biases appear close to land and ice and between ascending and descending orbits; they are linked to image reconstruction issues and instrument calibration and remain under study. We validate the SMOS SSS in conditions where these biases appear to be small. We compare SMOS and ARGO SSS over four regions far from land and ice using only ascending orbits. Four modelings of the impact of the wind on the sea surface emissivity have been tested. Results suggest that the L-band brightness temperature is not linearly related to the wind speed at high winds as expected in the presence of emissive foam, but that the foam effect is less than previously modeled. Given the large noise on individual SMOS measurements, a precision suitable for oceanographic studies can only be achieved after averaging SMOS SSS. Over selected regions and after mean bias removal, the precision on SSS retrieved from ascending orbits and averaged over 100 km $ times$ 100 km and 10 days is between 0.3 and 0.5 pss far from land and sea ice borders. These results have been obtained with forward models not fitted to satellite L-band measurements, and image reconstruction and instrument calibration are expected to improve. Hence, we anticipate that deducing, from SMOS measurements, SSS maps at 200 km $times$ 200 km, 10 days resolution with an accuracy of 0.2 pss at a global scale is not out of reach.},

  abstract = {The relationship between coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and salinity in an estuary is explored using a simple box model in which the river discharge and concentration of \{CDOM\} in the river are allowed to vary with time. The results are presented as analytical and graphical solutions. The behaviour of the estuary depends upon the ratio, Î², of the flushing time of the estuary to the timescale of the source variation. For small values of Î², the variation in \{CDOM\} concentration in the estuary tracks that in the source, producing a linear relationship on a CDOM-salinity plot. As Î² increases, the estuary struggles to keep up with the changes in the source; and a curved CDOM-salinity plot results. For very large values of Î², however, corresponding to estuaries with a long flushing time, the \{CDOM\} concentration in the estuary settles down to a mean value which again lies on a straight line on a CDOM-salinity plot (and extrapolates to the time-mean concentration in the source). The results are discussed in terms of the mapping of surface salinity in estuaries through the visible band remote sensing of CDOM.},

Detailed descriptions of several spatiotemporal and temporal noise reduction algorithms are provided. To aid in comparing between these different algorithms, we classify them based on their support (i.e., 3-D or 1-D filter) and whether or not motion compensation is employed. Several algorithms from each of the four categories are implemented and tested on real sequences degraded to various signal-to-noise ratios. These experimental results are discussed and analyzed to determine the overall advantages and disadvantages of the four general classifications, as well as, the individual filters},

  Abstract                 = {Climatological analyses of a historical data base have been carried out with the aim of reconstructing the three-dimensional temperature and salinity fields in the Mediterranean Sea. Seasonal and monthly distributions of hydrographic properties have been computed by a variational inverse method as an alternate to the standard Gandin (1969; Objective analysis of meterological fields, Israeli Program for Scientific Translation, Jerusalem) procedure. The spline solutions of the minimization problem are demonstrated to be numerically and theoretically equivalent to field estimates obtained by conventional objective analysis. The application of a finite-element technique allows analysis to be performed in the model space rather than in the observational space, which substantially improves the numerical efficiency of the procedure. The parameters of the scheme are adjusted according to the statistics of the climatological data. The results, realized as gridded data sets (horizontal resolution of 0.25Â°), show some trends in seasonal variability affecting the properties of water masses. As expected, the upper layer is subject to a well-defined seasonal signal affecting both the temperature and salinity fields. Error maps, reflecting the degree of uncertainty in the analyses, have been systematically produced. The present work is conceived as a basic support to more advanced studies such as diagnostic calculations, initialization of dynamical models, assimilation of hydrological data into primitive equation models, or planning of experimental surveys. New versions of the climatological fields will be released as data are added to the historical data base.},

  abstract = {The global ocean observing system is soon to be expanded to include two satellite missions \{SMOS\} and Aquarius that will provide the first global observations of sea surface salinity (SSS). Since the ocean responds to gradients in mass the need to more adequately observe salinity is not debatable. Previous studies for these missions have estimated that \{SSS\} observations will have a large expected error. Large observation error variance limits the potential impact for analyses of the full ocean state and even \{SSS\} itself. Estimating the impact of remotely sensed \{SSS\} on an ocean data assimilation system must be cast in the context of multi-variate contributions from both sea surface temperature and sea level anomaly. A simple analytical formulation for a multi-variate analysis of \{SSS\} is presented and used to derive diagnostics that estimate the magnitude of observation error variance that can be expected to contribute to the analysis of SSS. The diagnostics assess the likely impact of new observations in a multi-variate scheme where the forecast error covariance and observation error covariance have been estimated. As an example the diagnostics are applied to a specific ensemble optimal interpolation scheme, which has been used for eddy resolving reanalyses and operational predictions in the Asian-Australian region. This scheme dependent result indicates that sea surface temperature and sea level anomalies effectively constrain the forecast error variance of \{SSS\} in the mid- to high-latitudes. We conclude that remotely sensed \{SSS\} observations are expected to positively contribute to a multi-variate analysis in the tropical Indo-Pacific, but more modestly in the mid- to high-latitudes.},

  Abstract                 = {A technique for the objective analysis of oceanic data has been developed and used on simulated data. The technique is based on a standard statistical resultÃ¢â¬âthe Gauss-Markov Theorem-which gives an expression for the least square error linear estimate of some physical variable (velocity, stream function, temperature, etc.) given measurements at a limited number of data points, the statistics of the field being estimated in the form of space-time spectra, and the measurement errors. An expression for the r.m.s. error expected in this estimate is also derived and illustrated in the form of Ã¢â¬Ëerror mapsÃ¢â¬â¢. Efficient sampling arrays can be designed through trial-and-error adjustment of array configurations until a suitable balance of mapping coverage and accuracy, as measured by the error maps, is achieved. Examples of the mapping ability of some simple arrays are given. Using statistics inferred from the preliminary Mid Ocean Dynamics Experiments various realizations of likely flow fields were simulated. The 16 element MODE-I array was tested by comparison of the simulated fields and the objective maps based on inferred Ã¢â¬ËmeasurementsÃ¢â¬â¢ at the array points. The reliability of statistics inferred from observations was estimated by comparing correlations derived from limited observations of the simulated fields with the known statistics. Correlations derived from two realizations differed significantly but most calculations reproduced the known statistics moderately well. An intercomparison of Eulerian measurements (current meters) and Lagrangian measurements (neutrally buoyant drifters) was also carried out using the objective interpolation method.},

We devise a simple parametric model for the short-wave omnidirectional spectrum of the sea surface on the basis of a three-band (C, Ku, and Ka) and multi-incidence (low, moderate, and large) data set and an improved analytical scattering model, namely the non-Gaussian Weighted Curvature Approximation. This spectrum is also constrained by several optical measurements which provide a priori conditions on the total and filtered mean-square slopes. It is compared with classical models such as Elfouhaily and Kudryavtsev unified curvature spectra. Significant differences are observed at wave numbers corresponding to the range of decimeter scales. The new spectrum is by construction fully consistent with the omnidirectional normalized radar cross section of the multi-band data set.},

  Abstract                 = {The simulation and interpretation of microwave sea radar return in the near-nadir region are still issues in view of the limitations of the geometrical optics approximation and the multiscale and non-Gaussian nature of the surface. We show that an unambiguous and fully consistent physical approach can be reached in the framework of the physical optics. The model is developed on the basis of various satellite and airborne C-, Ku-, and Ka-band measurements using different reference surface roughness spectra. As found, the introduction of a peakedness correction based upon the excess kurtosis of slopes is necessary to obtain consistent analysis across the microwave frequency range. The model yields accurate simulations for the omnidirectional near-nadir normalized radar cross section in different frequency bands, provided the spectrum satisfies some a priori constraints on the distribution of the total and filtered slopes.},

  Abstract                 = {With the development of present and future low-frequency microwave missions (SMOS, Aquarius and SMAP), the need arises to estimate the effects of the ionosphere on the propagation of the electromagnetic waves. In this paper a methodology for assessing the contribution of the Faraday rotation to uncertainties in SMOS measurements over Antarctica is proposed. Particularly real TEC data and advanced geomagnetic filed model were used to compute the Faraday rotation. The obtained values demonstrate that the impact on the measured SMOS brightness temperature is in general very low reaching a maximum value of 0.2K.},

This research uses satellite-derived sea surface salinity from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive and ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity missions with altimetric sea surface height data to observe and quantify the redistribution of low-salinity water by Loop Current System interaction. Freshwater flux in this region during summer months is modulated by Loop Current System configuration as classified by three states. An extended Loop Current transports low-salinity water southward to the Florida Straits. A Loop Current eddy near the Louisiana-Texas shelf recirculates low-salinity water within the central Gulf. During a retracted Loop Current, no interaction occurs and low-salinity water remains close to the coast in the northern Gulf.},

  Abstract                 = {Modeling the effect of a rough airâsea interface on an acoustic signal is of considerable practical importance; for example, it is relevant in the detection of underwater mines, torpedoes, and submarines. Several promising theories have been developed for rough surface scattering. Among the most successful is the small slope approximation (SSA) [A. G. Voronovich, Sov. Phys. JETP 62, 65â70 (1985)]. Recent numerical studies [see S. L. Broschat and E. I. Thorsos, submitted to J. Acoust. Soc. Am. (1996), and references therein] have shown that the higherâorder SSA gives excellent results over a broad range of scattering angles for rms surface slopes up to 1. However, at the lowest forward grazing angles the results become somewhat high. At these angles multiple interactions with the surface at distant points have an appreciable effect on scattering levels. Voronovich recently modified the SSA to extend the nonlocal scatteringeffects [A. G. Voronovich, Waves in Random Media 6, 151 (1996)]. In this paper, a preliminary numerical study of the nonlocal small slope approximation (NLSSA) is presented. The equations for the lowestâorder bistatic scattering strength are derived, limiting cases are considered, and numerical results for a Gaussian spectrum are presented and compared with both original SSA and integral equation results.

The magnetic field integral equation for the current induced on the rough perfectly conducting surface is multiplied by a Fourier kernel involving all orders of surface height derivatives and their associated transform variables. Averages of this weighted equation are converted to convolations in the transform domain. The result of this operation is a singular integral equation of the first kind of infinite dimensions (because of the infinite number of height derivatives) for the stochastic Fourier transform of the current. A procedure is developed for estimating the effects of ignoring one or more surface height derivatives in terms of the range of validity of the resulting approximate solution. Special limiting cases of very gently undulating surfaces and uniformly rough surfaces are examined. New and illuminating results are obtained for the latter case.},

However, due to the use of an incorrect form for the shadowing function, its effect was erroneously evaluated. The correct shadowing function is incorporated into the earlier analysis and its impact on the scattering near grazing incidence is determined. Two consequences of shadowing are found to significantly reduce asigmadegnear grazing incidence. These effects result from the nonzero variance of the large-scale slopes and the total shadowing (with probability one) of points on the surface with unfavorably oriented slopes. Of the two effects, the former is the most significant since it causessigmadegto go to zero at grazing incidence. Particular attention is given to the physical reasoning behind the causes and effects of shadowing.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops new results pertaining to electromagnetic scattering from perfectly conducting random surfaces for which decorrelation does not imply statistical independence. Using an exact theory for the current induced on the surface and the far-field approximation for the scattered field, it is shown that the incoherent scattered power consists of two parts. The first part corresponds to the so-called diffuse scattered power. The second part is specular in its angular dependence and is a direct consequence of the fact that the two-point joint density for the surface height, slopes, etc., does not reduce to the product of the single-point joint densities for infinite separation distances. Computations for a gently undulating jointly exponentially distributed surface show that the incoherent specular power is equal to coherent scattered power for the Rayleigh parameter near 1. When the Rayleigh parameter is large, the incoherent specular power is significantly larger than the coherent power. The analysis further indicates that scattering measurements provide an ideal way for identifying this class of surfaces.},

This approach, unlike classical ones, is based on the formulation of the unsupervised change-detection problem in terms of the Bayesian decision theory. In this context, an adaptive semiparametric technique for the unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms associated with the gray levels of changed and unchanged pixels in a difference image is presented. Such a technique exploits the effectivenesses of two theoretically well-founded estimation procedures: the reduced Parzen estimate (RPE) procedure and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, thanks to the resulting estimates and to a Markov random field (MRF) approach used to model the spatial-contextual information contained in the multitemporal images considered, a change detection map is generated. The adaptive semiparametric nature of the proposed technique allows its application to different kinds of remote-sensing images. Experimental results, obtained on two sets of multitemporal remote-sensing images acquired by two different sensors, confirm the validity of the proposed approach},

  Abstract                 = {One of the main problems related to unsupervised change detection methods based on the âdifference imageâ lies in the lack of efficient automatic techniques for discriminating between changed and unchanged pixels in the difference image. Such discrimination is usually performed by using empirical strategies or manual trial-and-error procedures, which affect both the accuracy and the reliability of the change-detection process. To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper, the authors propose two automatic techniques (based on the Bayes theory) for the analysis of the difference image. One allows an automatic selection of the decision threshold that minimizes the overall change detection error probability under the assumption that pixels in the difference image are independent of one another. The other analyzes the difference image by considering the spatial-contextual information included in the neighborhood of each pixel. In particular, an approach based on Markov Random Fields (MRFs) that exploits interpixel class dependency contexts is presented. Both proposed techniques require the knowledge of the statistical distributions of the changed and unchanged pixels in the difference image. To perform an unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms that characterize these distributions, they propose an iterative method based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both proposed techniques},

As a novel contribution of this paper, such joint probabilities are automatically estimated by applying a specific formulation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to the data to be classified. Experiments carried out on a multisource and multitemporal data set confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach},

  Abstract                 = {Experiments with a low resolution, primitive equation ocean general circulation model with idealized basin geometry and surface forcing have been carried out in order to identify the processes controlling the climatically important aspects of the circulation. Emphasis was placed on the sensitivity of the model solutions to the magnitude of the vertical diffusivity. Scaling arguments suggest, and the numerical experiments confirm, that the solutions are most sensitive to the magnitudes of the wind stress curl and the vertical diffusivity. For small vertical diffusivity, wind forcing dominates the solution. The vertical scale of the thermocline is set by the strength of the Ekman pumping, and there is a multiple gyre circulation in the upper layers. For large vertical diffusivity, diabatic surface forcing dominates the solution. Vertical diffusion controls the vertical scale of the thermocline, and there is a single large anticyclonic gyre in the upper layers. Both the meridionally and zonally integrated overturning circulations are sensitive to the vertical diffusivity, though not to the same degree. The poleward heat transport is dominated by the zonally integrated meridional overturning circulation and, hence, also shows a sensitivity to the vertical diffusivity. The maximum poleward heat transport for the model used in this study varies by an order of magnitude as the vertical diffusivity is varied over a range comparable to that of estimates based on observations. The sensitivity to the prescription of the surface diabatic forcing and to other closure parameters is also described.},

  Abstract                 = {The meridional transport of heat by ocean currents in the northern hemisphere, as calculated from heat-balance maps of the oceans compiled by Budyko and Albrecht, is compared with a similar calculation by Sverdrup. The transports are in best agreement in the northern part of the North Atlantic. Discrepancies occur in the Pacific and in the equatorial Atlantic. To calculate meridional heat transport directly, a method is formulated for combining hydrographic station data and climatological estimates of surface wind stress. The method is applied to hydrographic sections made by individual expeditions during the IGY and NORPAC programs. Transient changes in the density field introduce a large sampling error, but these measurements have the advantage of providing some physical insight into the mechanism of heat transport. The principal conclusions of the study are: (a) Circulations in the vertical plane account for at least half as much meridional heat transport as the large-scale horizontal circulation of ocean basins; (b) the NORPAC Pacific section made in August 1955 at 35Â°N indicates a transport of heat southward, toward the equator, comparable in magnitude to northward heat transport measured in the North Atlantic.},

  Abstract                 = {Airborne and satellite retrieval of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) using L-band microwave radiometers requires accurate corrections for the influence of wind-induced Sea Surface Roughness (SSR) on the retrievals. We describe an airborne experiment, Virgo II, that combined an L-band microwave radiometer for retrieving SSS, with L- and S-band reflectometer systems for retrieving SSR descriptors including Mean Square Slope (MSS) and Wind Speed (WS) under a range of surface wind and wave conditions. The research objective is to use the SSR descriptors derived from the reflectometers to correct the brightness temperatures observed by the L-band radiometer, and produce more accurate SSS retrievals. Here we describe our experimental investigations to assess the feasibility of this approach. Preliminary comparisons of WS data retrieved from the reflectometers with coincident WS data from in situ platforms and an atmospheric circulation model indicate that after correcting for apparent biases, the reflectometry-derived SSR descriptors could, indeed, provide reliable corrections for the L-band radiometer salinity retrieval.},

  Abstract                 = {Significant wave height and wind speed fields from ERA-40 are validated against buoy, ERS-1, and Topex altimeter measurements. To do so, we propose and apply a triple collocation statistical model. The model takes into account the random errors in observations and model results and allows the estimation of the variances of the errors. We first examine the case where the random errors of the different systems are independent, but situations where independence is not strictly observed are also considered. The results show that the ERA-40 predictions underestimate high values of significant wave height and, contrary to what would be obtained by less sophisticated statistical methods, wind speed, that the variance of the errors associated with the ERA-40 system is much higher than that of the errors of the measurements, and that the former shows a dependence on the value of the observations not present in the latter. The altimeter measurements of significant wave height are very precise, in contrast to the large uncertainty associated with the altimeter retrieved wind speeds.},

  Abstract                 = {<span class='snippet'>Sea</span> surface salinity can be remotely measured by means of L-band microwave radiometry. However, the brightness temperature also depends on the <span class='snippet'>sea</span> surface temperature and on the <span class='snippet'>sea</span> state, which is probably today one of the driving factors in the salinity retrieval error budgets of the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission and the NASA-Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales Aquarius/SAC-D mission. This paper describes the Passive Advanced Unit (PAU) for ocean monitoring. PAU combines in a single instrument three different sensors: an L-band radiometer with digital beamforming (DBF) (PAU-RAD) to measure the brightness temperature of the <span class='snippet'>sea</span> at different incidence angles simultaneously, a global positioning system (GPS) reflectometer [PAU-reflectometer of Global Navigation Satellite Signals (GNSS-R)] also with DBF to measure the <span class='snippet'>sea</span> state from the delay-Doppler maps, and two infrared radiometers to provide <span class='snippet'>sea</span> surface temperature estimates. The key characteristic of this instrument is that both PAU-RAD and the PAU-GNSS/R share completely the RF/IF front-end, and analog-to-digital converters. Since in order to track the GPS-reflected signal, it is not possible to chop the antenna signal as in a Dicke radiometer, a new radiometer topology has been devised which makes uses of two receiving chains and a correlator, which has the additional advantage that both PAU-RAD and PAU-GNSS/R can be operated continuously and simultaneously to perform the <span class='snippet'>sea</span>-state corrections of the brightness temperature. This paper presents the main characteristics of the different PAU subsystems, and analyzes in detail the PAU-radiometer concept.},

  abstract  = {The SMOS Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission was selected in May 1999 by the European Space Agency to provide global and frequent soil moisture and <span class='snippet'>sea</span> salinity maps. SMOS' single payload is MIRAS (Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis), an L-band two-dimensional aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer with multi-angular observation capabilities. Two-dimensional brightness temperature images are obtained by processing the cross-relations measured by pairs of signals collected by each of the 72 elements of a Y-shaped array. Due to the significant differences with respect to its radio-astronomy predecessors (larger number of receiving channels and wider field-of-view) during the past decade a detailed instrument error model was studied, as well as new calibration and image reconstruction techniques. The analysis of the overall performance of this complex instrument required the implementation of an end-to-end performance simulator (<span class='snippet'>Camps</span>, 1996; Corbella et al., 2003; <span class='snippet'>Camps</span> et al., 2002), which has been and it is currently being used in the technical design trade-off of the instrument. This software tool was also designed to help both the engineers working in the instrument and mission design and the scientific community in the implementation of new multi-angular algorithms for soil moisture and ocean salinity retrieval. This paper briefly describes the main functionalities and capabilities of the present and next versions of the SMOS End-to-end Performance Simulator (SEPS) and presents examples of application to the soil moisture (SM) and <span class='snippet'>sea</span> surface salinity (SSS) retrieval problems.},

  Abstract                 = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission was selected in May 1999 by the European Space Agency to provide global and frequent soil moisture and sea surface salinity maps. SMOS' single payload is Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS), an L band two-dimensional aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer with multiangular observation capabilities. Most geophysical parameter retrieval errors studies have assumed the independence of measurements both in time and space so that the standard deviation of the retrieval errors decreases with the inverse of square root of the number of measurements being averaged. This assumption is especially critical in the case of sea surface salinity (SSS), where spatiotemporal averaging is required to achieve the ultimate goal of 0.1 psu error. This work presents a detailed study of the SSS error reduction by spatiotemporal averaging, using the SMOS end-to-end performance simulator (SEPS), including thermal noise, all instrumental error sources, current error correction and image reconstruction algorithms, and correction of atmospheric and sky noises. The most important error sources are the biases that appear in the brightness temperature images. Three different sources of biases have been identified: errors in the noise injection radiometers, Sun contributions to the antenna temperature, and imaging under aliasing conditions. A calibration technique has been devised to correct these biases prior to the SSS retrieval at each satellite overpass. Simulation results show a retrieved salinity error of 0.2 psu in warm open ocean, and up to 0.7 psu at high latitudes and near the coast, where the external calibration method presents more difficulties.},

  Abstract                 = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission was selected in May 1999 by the European Space Agency Earth Observation Programme Board to provide global and frequent soil moisture (SM) and <span class='snippet'>sea</span> surface salinity (SSS) maps. SMOS' single payload is the Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) sensor, an L-band two-dimensional aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer with multiangular and polarimetric imaging capabilities. The definition of the SMOS Level 2 Processor requires the selection of the optimum operation mode (dual-polarization or full-polarimetric) for each application, the specification of the required auxiliary data, and the optimum retrieval algorithms. Using the SMOS simulator and based on the experience gained in previous works, this paper presents a study of the SM and SSS retrieval capabilities over homogeneous pixels, in the two modes of operation with different auxiliary data. It is found that SSS retrievals using the first Stokes parameter measured in the dual-polarization mode perform somewhat worse than using the vertical (T<sub>vv</sub>) and horizontal (T<sub>hh</sub>) brightness temperatures measured in the full-polarimetric mode, and the performance degrades for cold waters due to the lower sensitivity of the brightness temperature to SSS at low <span class='snippet'>sea</span> surface temperature (SST). Due to the larger angular variation of T<sub>hh</sub> and T<sub>vv</sub>, SM retrievals using T<sub>hh</sub> and T<sub>vv</sub> measured in the full-polarimetric mode exhibit a significant better performance over bare soils than over vegetation-covered soils. Over vegetation-covered soils vegetation parameters (opacity and albedo) can be inferred over a 550-km swath width in the full-polarimetric mode. However, since the first Stokes parameter is independent of both geometric and Faraday rotations, it is very robust in the presence of instrumental and geophysical errors. In the SSS retrieval problem and in the SM retrieval problem (with T<sub>hh</sub> and T<sub>vv</sub> measured in the full-polarimetric mode), the performance of the retrieval algorithms tested is not significantly altered if the model parameters are not exactly known, but are left as adjustable parameters in the optimization process.},

  Abstract                 = {Drastically different sea states result for a growing, decaying, or a fully-developed sea due to the presence of a wind field. In addition, the sea state is altered by the superposition of oceanic currents on the wave field created by the wind. This study presents a numerical analysis of the change in the sea surface brightness temperature at L-band computed using the SSA model and a modified Kitaigorodskii-Pierson-Moskowitz sea surface spectrum to account for the presence of surface water currents. Their impact on the brightness temperature variations is evaluated and compared to the brightness temperature fluctuations observed from a tower-based field experiment. The consequences for salinity retrievals from space using L-band radiometry are discussed},

SMOS payload is MIRAS: an L-band 2D aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer, that generates brightness temperature images by processing the cross-correlations measured between the pairs of signals collected by each array element. In this paper we compare the results of the error budget used in previous SMOS studies to those obtained from a simulation campaign for different scenarios (brightness temperature input scenes). The total radiometric error, which includes the radiometric sensitivity term mainly due to the finite integration time, and the radiometric accuracy due to instrumental imperfections as well as residual calibration error, is computed from a series of 20 Monte Carlo simulations for each instrument configuration and scenario for both the brightness temperatures retrieved in the antenna reference frame (X- and Y-polarizations) and the Earth reference frame (V- and H- polarizations at each pixel). Finally, intercalibration instrumental drifts due to in-orbit temperature variations are analyzed using a standard configuration.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new technique to analyze L-band signals of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that have rebounded off the sea surface, with the aim of retrieving information about surface roughness in the form of the effective Probability Density Function (PDF) of the slopes. Unlike earlier techniques, which parameterize the PDF (usually as normal bivariate distributions), this approach does not constrain the surface slopes' PDF to the shape of a particular analytical distribution. This may help to understand the real information content of L-band scattered signals, which is currently unclear. After validating the algorithm by means of end-to-end simulations, we have applied it to real data. The tests on real data show that the retrievals are robust, consistent with the results obtained with standard GNSS-reflection techniques, and in agreement with independent sources of information. Moreover, the retrieved slopes' PDF present non-Gaussian features, such as skewness. A more in-depth analysis to check whether the skewness is a geophysical signature or an artifact of the technique, shows that it maps with the up-/down-asymmetries introduced by surface forces. In particular, this is the first time that GNSS-reflections have sensed and identified the up- and down-wind signature on the surface, putting and end to the 180\'e ambiguity that was usually attributed to GNSS observations of directional roughness.},

  abstract = {The authors explore the accuracy of a comprehensive 46-year retrospective analysis of upper-ocean temperature, salinity, and currents. The Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) analysis is global, spanning the latitude range 62\B0S62\B0N. The SODA analysis has been constructed using optimal interpolation data assimilation combining numerical model forecasts with temperature and salinity profiles (MBT, XBT, CTD, and station), sea surface temperature, and altimeter sea level. To determine the accuracy of the analysis, the authors present a series of comparisons to independent observations at interannual and longer timescales and examine the structure of well-known climate features such as the annual cycle, El NiÃ±o, and the Pacific-North American (PNA) anomaly pattern. A comparison to tide-gauge time series records shows that 25%-35% of the variance is explained by the analysis. Part of the variance that is not explained is due to unresolved mesoscale phenomena. Another part is due to errors in the rate of water mass formation and errors in salinity estimates. Comparisons are presented to altimeter sea level, WOCE global hydrographic sections, and to moored and surface drifter velocity. The results of these comparisons are quite encouraging. The differences are largest in the eddy production regions of the western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The differences are generally smaller in the Tropics, although the major equatorial currents are too broad and weak. The strongest basin-scale signal at interannual periods is associated with El NiÃ±o. Examination of the zero-lag correlation of global heat content shows the eastern and western tropical Pacific to be out of phase (correlation â0.4 to â0.6). The eastern Indian Ocean is in phase with the western Pacific and thus is out of phase with the eastern Pacific. The North Pacific has a weak positive correlation with the eastern equatorial Pacific. Correlations between eastern Pacific heat content and Atlantic heat content at interannual periods are modest. At longer decadal periods the PNA wind pattern leads to broad patterns of correlation in heat content variability. Increases in heat content in the central North Pacific are associated with decreases in heat content in the subtropical Pacific and increases in the western tropical Pacific. Atlantic heat content is positively correlated with the central North Pacific.},

  Abstract                 = {The presence of radio frequency interferences (RFIs) in the data collected by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission led by the European Space Agency is larger than what was anticipated, and it has a strong impact on the retrieval of these geophysical parameters. The first efforts to deal with this problem were proposed by DEIMOS Engenharia in the Level 1 Prototype Processor released in November 2010, and they are also a part of its latest versions. DEIMOS focused on three key aspects to detect the RFIs, to mitigate these sources, and to flag the data in SMOS products affected by RFIs. The detection algorithm is based on a statistic approach that computes the most probable position of the RFI source based on multiangular observations made by SMOS. The mitigation algorithm has been designed taking as reference the existing technique to remove the sun effect. The mechanism to flag the data has been developed in cooperation with the European Space Agency and consists in flagging geolocated pixels according to the strength of the RFI. In this paper, three algorithms will be presented, as well as their results. For completion, a high-level description of the data processing for SMOS is also a part of this text.},

  Abstract                 = {Sea surface temperature (SST) measurements from drifting and moored buoys have been used extensively to validate satellite SST products. Previous efforts explored overall uncertainties in the buoy measurements, but did not quantify differences in the performance of different buoy types. Here, drifting and moored buoys stratified into open-ocean and coastal, were evaluated by manufacturer (drifters) and buoy program (moorings) to identify significant deviations in their suitability for satellite validation. Biases and standard deviations were computed for differences between the buoy SST measurements and two satellite references: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer SST product from Remote Sensing Systems and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office K10 analysis. No significant differences were found among the various drifting and tropical moored buoys, regardless of the manufacturer/program. The largest deviations were observed for the non-tropical moored buoys possibly in part due to calibration differences. In general, coastal buoys exhibited greater standard deviations associated with increased physical variability within the coastal regions. Tropical moored buoys showed smaller standard deviations than for the drifters resulting from better quality measurements or reduced variability in the tropics. Large deviations between the coastal moorings and the SST references appeared linked to coastal currents with upwelling, rather than buoy performance. Coastal moorings provided sampling of small-scale coastal variability, not resolved in satellite products, offering the potential for improving poorly parameterized coastal SSTs. Differences due to diurnal warming were largely eliminated by constraining collocations between the satellite and the buoy to Â±1 h. Overall, most buoy types appear suitable for satellite SST validation.},

  abstract = {Continuous surface temperature and salinity measurements have been collected onboard a supply ship between Tasmania and Dumont D'Urville, Antarctica, as part of the SURVOSTRAL program (Surveillance de l'OcÃ©an Austral). The ship makes 6-10 repeat sections per year from October to March for the period 1993-1999, and these measurements form the longest time series of spring and summer variations available in the Southern Ocean. The surface fronts are more clearly indicated with the salinity data than the temperature data. The Levitus climatological and Reynolds satellite monthly mean sea surface temperature data compare well with our surface temperature data: All data sets are dominated by the large-scale seasonal heating cycle with similar amplitude and phase. The SURVOSTRAL monthly mean sea surface salinity data show weak seasonal variations, except in the Antarctic Continental Zone where seasonal sea-ice variations introduce large surface freshwater fluctuations. The Levitus climatological surface salinity has too much seasonal variability and fails to reproduce the sharp fronts, the near-constant salinity in the Antarctic Zone, and the seasonal freshening near Antarctica. This has important consequences for projects that use Levitus climatology data to establish the surface salinity structure and water mass characteristics.},

Functional relationship analysis (FRA) employing the error-in-variables method is found to be more exact in comparison with classical linear regression analysis for the validation of the OSCAT data. Moreover, using the wind component domain for validation and error assessment rather than the speed and direction domain is confirmed to be favourable. The FRA method applied on the triple-collocated wind components shows that the error standard deviations of the OSCAT and buoy winds are quite similar. The calibration trends and biases for OSCAT, buoys and ECMWF are found to be close to unity and zero, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {The vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind in the lowest 8 metres over a reservoir (1Â·6 km Ã 1 km) has been measured using sensitive anemometers freely exposed from a fixed mast in water 16 m deep, the fetch being more than 1 km. The resulting profiles are closely logarithmic, the small differences being systematic and possibly due to the thermal instability which existed when the measurements were made.The usual law for wind profiles in neutral stability is \documentclass{article}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}$$ \frac{u}{{u_* }}\; = \;\frac{1}{k}\;\log \;\frac{z}{{z(0)}} $$\end{document} where u is the wind speed at height z, k is von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n's constant, log z (0) the intercept on the log z axis, and u* the so-called friction velocity defined by Ï0 = puâ*2, Ï0 being the surface drag and rH the density of the air.To characterize the profiles u*/k, their slope, was plotted in relation to z (0), their intercept; this allowed a direct comparison with other profiles, in particular those recently measured in a laboratory channel by Sibul. The agreement was better than expected and indicated that z (0) was comparatively independent of fetch and stability but was largely determined by u*. The relation between u* and z (0) agreed roughly with the simplest non-dimensional relation between them, gz (0)/uâ*2 = constant, so that one is led to a generalized wind profile for flow over a water surface \documentclass{article}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}$$ \frac{u}{{u_* }}\; = \;\frac{1}{k}\;\log \;\frac{{gz}}{{u_* ^2 }}\; + \;{\rm constant} $$\end{document} which specifies the drag, given the wind at one known height. An approximate value of the constant is 12Â·5.This expression can be compared with earlier work. The better wind-profile observations show rough agreement; the experimental scatter is necessarily large since a water surface is aerodynamically much smoother than most land surfaces, precision anemometry in difficult circumstances being required to provide sufficiently precise values. Oceanographic measurements of the tilt of water surfaces are in fair agreement at high wind speeds but at low wind speeds the data are conflicting. The early results which imply that the drag-coefficient (uâ*2/u2) increases with decreasing wind speed in light winds are thought to be in error; some support for this belief comes from recent estimates of drag using a modified ageostrophic technique, which agree roughly among themselves and with the general expression.},

Air-sea interaction oversea surface temperature fronts throughout the world ocean is evident in both the curl and divergence fields, as are the influences of islands and coastal mountains. Ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream generate distinctive patterns in the curl field.

  month    = {Jun},
  abstract = {Primarily due to the constraints of observation technologies (both field and satellite measurements), our understanding of ocean salinity is much less mature compared to ocean temperature. As a result, the characterizations of the two most important properties of the ocean are unfortunately out of step: the former is one generation behind the latter in terms of data availability and applicability. This situation has been substantially changed with the advent of the Argo floats which measure the two variables simultaneously on a global scale since early this century. The first decade of Argo-acquired salinity data are analyzed here in the context of climatology and seasonality, yielding the following main findings for the global upper oceans. First, the six well-defined ``salty pools'' observed around {\textpm}20{\textdegree} in each hemisphere of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans are found to tilt westward vertically from the sea surface to about 600Â m depth, forming six saline cores within the subsurface oceans. Second, while potential temperature climatology decreases monotonically to the bottom in most places of the ocean, the vertical distribution of salinity can be classified into two categories: A double-halocline type forming immediately above and below the local salinity maximum around 100--150 m depths in the tropical and subtropical oceans, and a single halocline type existing at about 100Â m depth in the extratropical oceans. Third, in contrast to the midlatitude dominance for temperature, seasonal variability of salinity in the oceanic mixed layer has a clear tropical dominance. Meanwhile, it is found that a two-mode structure with annual and semiannual periodicities can effectively penetrate through the upper ocean into a depth of {\textasciitilde}2000 m. Fourth, signature of Rossby waves is identified in the annual phase map of ocean salinity within 200--600 m depths in the tropical oceans, revealing a strongly co-varying nature of ocean temperature and salinity at specific depths. These results serve as significant contributions to improving our knowledge on the haline aspect of the ocean climate.},

The bispectrum is defined to be the Fourier transform of the bicoherence function. It is found that the surface bicoherence function and its first and second derivatives must all vanish at the origin. In general, the surface bispectrum is a complex function. Its real part is centrosymmetric, just like the surface spectrum, and its imaginary part is antisymmetric. A function with the above-stated properties is introduced to represent the imaginary part of the sea surface bispectrum. The unknown parameter in this function is calibrated using a data set from the FASINEX experiment. The sea surface backscattering model is based on an integral equation model which accounts for frequency, polarization, incident angle, azimuthal angle, and wind speed. It is found that the proposed bispectrum can be used to account for the up/down wind asymmetry},

  Abstract                 = {The moment method is used to calculate electromagnetic backscattering from one-dimensionally rough surfaces at near-grazing incidence (angles of incidence up to 89Â°). A periodic representation of the scattering surface is used to prevent edge effects in the calculated scattering without the use of an artificial illumination weighting function. A set of universal series common to all elements of the moment interaction matrix are derived that allow the efficient application of the moment method to the periodic surface. Comparison with other moment method implementations demonstrates the efficiency of this approach. The scattering from surfaces with Gaussian roughness spectra is calculated at both horizontal and vertical polarizations, and the results are compared with the theoretical predictions of the small-perturbation method (SPM) and Kirchhoff approximation (KA). SPM shows the expected loss of accuracy in predicting the vertically polarized backscattering from small-roughness, short-correlation-length surfaces at large incidence angles. SPM accurately predicts the backscattering from the same type of surface at incidence up to 89Â° at horizontal polarization, KA provides accurate estimates of the scattering from long correlation-length surfaces as long as the incidence angle is small enough that surface self-shadowing does not occur. When shadowing occurs, KA severely underpredicts vertically polarized backscattering and less severely overpredicts backscattering at horizontal polarization},

  abstract = {We investigate causes of interannual variability in Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) convection using a monthly mean global precipitation data set spanning 1979-1999. Starting from the hypothesis of two dominant influences on the ITCZ, namely, the cross-equatorial gradient in tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) and the anomalous Walker circulation due to the rearrangement of tropical Pacific convection associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, we analyze anomaly composites over the 1979-1999 period that best isolate the effects of each mechanism. Our results suggest that to first order, a strong anomalous Walker circulation suppresses precipitation over the tropical Atlantic, whereas an anomalous warm north/cool south SST gradient shifts the meridional location of maximum ITCZ convection anomalously north. We examined the processes underlying each of the two mechanisms. For the anomalous Walker circulation we find consistency with the idea of suppression of convection through warming of the tropical troposphere brought about by anomalous convective heating in the eastern equatorial Pacific. For the SST gradient mechanism our results confirm previous studies that link convection to cross-equatorial winds forced by meridional SST gradients. We find that positive surface flux feedback brought about through the cross-equatorial winds is weak and confined to the deep tropics. On the basis of the results of this and other studies we propose an expanded physical picture that explains key features of Atlantic ITCZ variability, including its seasonal preference, its sensitivity to small anomalous SST gradients, and its role in the context of tropical Atlantic SST gradient variability.},

Multi-incidence angles PR data are used to retrieve surface wave slope parameter and normalized nadir backscatter. After that, an empirical wind speed model was developed based on those two parameters that attenuates the surface tilting effect. The inversion is defined using a multilayer perceptron neural network with radar-derived backscatter and surface wave slope parameter as inputs. Results show the root mean square errs between retrieved wind speeds and in situ buoy observations is 1.36m/s, bias is nearly zero, revealing good agreements in wind speed estimations.},

  Abstract                 = {The scattering of electromagnetic waves from a periodic dielectric interface is studied for a general angle of incidence. It is called conical diffraction in grating theory for the general case where the incident wave vector is not perpendicular to the ruling direction of the gratings. We adopt the electric and magnetic field components along the row direction as the two unknown scalar functions and reduce the vector nature of the problem to solving simple matrix equations to obtain the scattered fields. The extended boundary condition method is applied with the Fourier series expansion for the surface fields. For the special case of incidence angle perpendicular to the row direction, the results are reduced to those developed before. Numerical results are obtained to show that energy conservation and reciprocity are obeyed for scattering by sinusoidal surfaces for the general case. This serves to check the consistency of the formalism.},

  abstract = {The theories of observation and measurement of the average noncoherent scattering parameters for expansive scenes are developed and interpreted. The theory identifies all the scattering parameters and in this regard introduces three scattering coefficients not previously defined. The result is compared with the theory for coherent targets and a unique feature is identified. This feature, induced by spatial averaging, enables the theory to admit partially polarized returns. Intensity (power) and correlation techniques similar to that for coherent targets are proposed to measure all the scattering parameters. The sensitivity of the intensity technique to various practical realizations of the antenna polarization requirements is presented by means of computer simulated measurements. The simulations were conducted with a scattering characteristic similar to that of the sea. However, these results with the help of the theory axe easily extended to other characteristics. It is shown that careful adherence to the antenna polarization specifications is required to measure the weaker scattering parameters. In the case of the weaker parameters the complete antenna polarization property including the amplitude and relative phase of the orthogonal polarizations must be documented to validate the measurement. The results of this paper are useful for specifying radar scatterometer antennas, for designing meaningful noncoherent scattering experiments and for interpreting the character of scatterometer returns.},

  Abstract                 = {During the northern hemisphere winter the surface atmospheric pressure on the Gulf of Mexico side of Central America is often higher than that on the Pacific side. The resultant southward pressure gradient drives strong southward winds through a gap in the Sierra Madre mountain range at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The atmospheric jet is narrow in comparison with the relevant radius of deformation, so when it leaves the coast and flows out over the Gulf of Tehuantepec, it is an inertial jet. Therefore the jet is expected to be deflected into a clockwise inertial circle by the Coriolis force. A similar process should also occur for Central American atmospheric jets through mountain range gaps near the Gulf of Papagayo. Satellite measurements of sea surface temperature together with coastal wind data for the first 41 days of 1986 were examined to see if the expected wind path influenced sea surface temperature (SST) near the Gulf of Tehuantepec and the Gulf of Papagayo. Consecutive daily satellite images when the coastal southward Tehuantepec wind increased suggest that the initial development of cold surface water in a clockwise loop is due to the wind mixing the shallow thermocline surface water along its inertial path. A simple 1Â½-layer analytical ocean model suggests, in agreement with observations, that the wind can drive surface quasi-geostrophic currents of â¼1 m sâ1. Since the wind path is circular, the wind actually generates a clockwise rotating ocean eddy with the approximate scale of the wind inertial circle. The satellite sea surface temperature measurements also suggest that the wind-driven surface ocean current is unstable. In addition, stronger gradients in SST to the right of the expected wind flow are consistent with advection of sea surface temperature by ocean surface Ekman flow.},

The approach allows us to construct densities that satisfy given constraints such as joint moments or conditional moments. Also, we show that the kernel has to be signal dependent and that to obtain a proper distribution it should be the ratio of two characteristic functions.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of rain on the ocean surface alters the relationship between the surface wind vector and microwave backscatter, presenting an obstacle to wind retrieval via scatterometry. To address the effect of rain on surface backscatter, we develop a physically based ocean surface wave model modified by rain. Microwave backscatter is then calculated using a multiscale scattering model. Comparisons to observations at Ku band are used to validate and tune our surface model. Simulations give insight into backscattering surface features: ring waves result primarily from the collapse of the splash-created stalk, and the impulse responsible for the generation of ring waves has a radius roughly 5 times the drop's radius. Comparisons also show that backscatter from stationary splash features is necessary to accurately reproduce the effect of rain at Ku band. For Ku band our simulations expand upon prior measurements showing that rain increases backscatter and diminishes azimuthal variations. There is, however, a wind relative azimuthal signature in the backscatter for most rainfall rates. Simulations at Ka band, C band, and L band without the contribution from stationary splash features show that rain-created ring waves often alter backscatter. The effects are greatest at Ka band where they mirror changes to the very high-frequency region of the surface wave spectrum. C band backscatter is increased at moderate and high incidence angles and is sensitive to rain-induced damping. The effect of rain on L band is to decrease backscatter at high rain rate, and it is also dependent on rain-induced damping.},

  abstract = {The traditional view of geometrical optics as the ray-tracing procedure for the design of mirror, prism, and lens systems of uniform optical components, has become enlarged in recent years. This has been brought about by the applications of electromagnetic systems at ever decreasing wavelengths on the one hand, and by new optical components, such as optical fibers and integrated optical elements, on the other. The range of geometrical optics now includes such concepts as optics-in-the-large, wide-angle and aspheric designs, geodesic optics, and the optics of nonuniform media. The introduction of electromagnetic field theory in this area involves effects such as diffraction, fields near caustics, and evanescent fields. These are also being discussed in a ray optical interpretation, usually presented as the first-order term in an asymptotic expansion. The optical processes have, in turn, introduced some new geometrical theorems and matrix methods which have applications in the overall geometrical optics science. This paper sets out to review these methods and, in view of the commonly expressed compatibility between the two aspects, to investigate the applications of the geometrical theory to the electromagnetic field description. Indications are given as to possible methods available for the definition of a geometrical electromagnetic field theory which would contain the geometrical theories of the optical field in a covariant transformation theory of the electromagnetic field. It is shown that this is compatible with current methods being applied to the unity of all physics in which geometrical optics is the first-order approximation occupying a central position.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Eight years of Gulf Stream data were examined to determine the percentage of meander crests that give rise to warm core rings. Because of cloud cover in many of the satellite images it was not possible to associate a specific meander crest with each warm core ring formed, nor was it possible to follow each meander crest from the point at which its amplitude was first detectable to the point at which it left the study area, was absorbed by another meander, or split to form two meanders. Despite these problems, a lower bound of 0.24 could be placed on the probability that a meander crest detaches to form a warm core ring. This was obtained by considering all disturbances in the path of the Gulf Stream that could be tracked over a several day period. If consideration is restricted to disturbances with a length scale the size of warm core rings or larger, the probability of formation increases to 0.40. The authors argue that this is a more interesting number in that the wavelength of the meanders observed rarely (less than 20% of the time) increased by more than 50% of their initial value; hence only ring-scale meander crests can result in warm core rings, of these more than 40% do.

Nevertheless, the solutions proposed in the literature present numerous differences. Through a rigorous treatment of the large-scale slopes we explain why some popular correcting factors actually should be omitted. Besides its simplicity, the resulting model is not restricted to situations where the large-scale process has small slopes. The proof is given for the general case of bistatic scattering from lossy dielectric surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {The Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) displays important seasonal, interannual and decadal variability. The correct representation of the EUC in ocean general circulation models (OGCM) is of primary importance for an adequate simulation of the Tropical Pacific Ocean, and for the ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) cycle. This study aims at better understanding the EUC termination and its interactions with the three-dimensional circulation in the eastern Pacific in a climate-type OGCM. It also aims at improving the realism of the EUC in this region where some deficiencies were previously noticed. Several sensitivity experiments have been performed from 1993 to 2000, and the model results are compared to TAO observations. The sensitivity to vertical and lateral eddy mixing coefficients is explored, and we find that the 3-D equatorial circulation is highly sensitive to a reduction of the background vertical eddy coefficients in the surface layers. This reduction is only possible because of the change in the advection scheme and leads to a great improvement in the annual mean and the seasonal cycle of the modelled EUC, increasing both the EUC and the tropical cells transports. However, it appears that in the eastern Pacific, the increase in EUC transport is largely independent of the increase in the 3-D circulation. This is also true for the seasonal cycle transport. Reducing the isopycnal mixing coefficients further improves the mean EUC speed, but does not modify the associated 3-D circulation. Adding the Galapagos Archipelago to the model bathymetry only induces very local changes in the equatorial 3-D circulation. However, it leads to important changes in the pathways of EUC waters that reach the South American coast.},

  Abstract                 = {Airplane aerodynamic characteristics correlate aircraft speed with vertical wind velocity, making the time average inappropriate for estimating the ensemble average in airborne eddy-correlation flux computations. The space average, the proper form, is implemented as a time integral by a transformation of variables, which can be interpreted as a ground-speed correction to the time average. The mathematical forms are presented, and the importance of the speed correction is illustrated with airborne data. The computed correction is found to be highly variable, depending on both the turbulent flow encountered and the aircraft used. In general, the speed connection becomes more important as airplane size is reduced. For a small, single-engine Long-EZ airplane, used as an example, the straight time average erred, half the time, by 12%, 10%, 20%, and 15%, respectively, for computed fluxes of momentum, heat, moisture, and CO2. For a much heavier Twin Otter airplane, also used as an example, the straight time average erred, half the time by only 1%. These errors increased with decreasing altitude for the Long-EZ and with increasing altitude for the Twin Otter.},

  Abstract                 = {Many previous studies have demonstrated the viability of estimating advective ocean surface currents from sequential infrared satellite imagery using the maximum cross-correlation (MCC) technique when applied to 1.1-km-resolution Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal infrared imagery. Applied only to infrared imagery, cloud cover and undesirable viewing conditions (gaps in satellite data and edge-of-scan distortions) limit the spatial and temporal coverage of the resulting velocity fields. In addition, MCC currents are limited to those represented by the displacements of thermal surface patterns, and hence, isothermal flow is not detected by the MCC method. The possibility of supplementing MCC currents derived from thermal AVHRR imagery was examined, with currents calculated from 1.1-km-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color imagery, which often have spatial patterns complementary to the thermal infrared patterns. Statistical comparisons are carried out between yearlong collections of thermal and ocean color derived MCC velocities for the central California Current. It is found that the image surface patterns and resulting MCC velocities complement one another to reduce the effects of poor viewing conditions and isothermal flow. The two velocity products are found to agree quite well with a mean correlation of 0.74, a mean rms difference of 7.4 cm/s, and a mean bias less than 2 cm/s which is considerably smaller than the established absolute error of the MCC method. Merging the thermal and ocean color MCC velocity fields increases the spatial coverage by approximately 25% for this specific case study},

  abstract = {The aim of this article is to summarize the historical process which led to recovering the concept of a ray, typical of the pre-Maxwell theory of light, from wave theory. To this end, the contributions of Huygens (1690), Newton (1704), Young (1801), and Fresnel (1816), which can be considered the founders of the modern science of optics, are briefly described, giving evidence to some aspects that led to the formulation of the ondulatory theory of light. Then, it is seen how the concept of a ray was recovered from Kirchhoff's diffraction theory, which can be interpreted as a rigorous formulation of Fresnel's ideas. The key role of the Maggi-Rubinowicz (1888, 1924) representation of Kirchhoff's diffraction integral, which can be interpreted as the mathematical expression of Young's theory of diffraction, is discussed. Also, it is noted that the first theoretical derivation of diffracted rays, and of the cone of diffraction, was due to Adalbert Rubinowicz (1917). He was one of Sommerfeld's assistants, in Munich, in analyzing the transmission of a high-frequency field through an aperture in an opaque screen. The ideas which are briefly summarized produced the basis for the statement of the geometrical theory of diffraction. This ray theory, which is the natural extension of geometrical optics (GO), was presented by J.B. Keller, in 1953.<>},

  Abstract                 = {Modifications to the L.A. Klein et al. model (1997) for specular ocean emissivity have recently been suggested by W.J. Ellison et al. (1996) in order to improve the performance at high microwave frequencies. The work presented in the present article tests both the original and modified models using a set of satellite and ground-based observations that is designed to eliminate as much as possible the dependence of the test on parameters other than the surface emission itself. Clear sky, low humidity, and low wind conditions were used exclusively to reduce the dependence of the test on atmospheric and wind-roughened sea models. Radiosonde observations (RaObs) coincident with TOPEX satellite overpasses were used to reduce errors due to inexact knowledge of the atmosphere. Their tests confirm the superior performance of the Ellison model at higher frequencies. In an effort to remove the residual bias between the models and the observations, they also suggest a parameterized modification to both models that âbest fitsâ the models to the data. In this case, the modified Ellison model maintains its superior performance at high frequencies, suggesting that it has an inherently more accurate frequency dependence. The root mean-squared (RMS) error in the modified Ellison emissivity model, over the range of 18-40 GHz, is found to be 0.0037, which translates into a model error of approximately 1 K in terms of brightness temperatures},

  Abstract                 = {The birth of a warm core ring is conceptualized as a catastrophic separation process governed by the strong inertial forces within a western boundary current. A frictionless theory based on this postulate and assumed geostrophic balance on completion of the separation process yields a description of ring geometry and velocity distribution in first-order agreement with observation. In particular, maximum velocities of the order of 1 m sâ1 are predicted to occur near the perimeter. The initial decay rate of the ring is estimated from an interface friction and entrainment model (using the above maximum velocity) to be about 0.05 dayâ1, which reduces rapidly, however, as the ring slows down. Interface friction is found to be much more important than entrainment in producing the decay.},

  abstract = {High-resolution surface fluxes over the global ocean are needed to evaluate coupled atmosphere-ocean models and weather forecasting models, provide surface forcing for ocean models, understand the regional and temporal variations of the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and ocean, and provide a large-scale context for field experiments. Under the auspices of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Radiation Panel, the SEAFLUX Project has been initiated to investigate producing a high-resolution satellite-based dataset of surface turbulent fluxes over the global oceans to complement the existing products for surface radiation fluxes and precipitation. The SEAFLUX Project includes the following elements: a library of in situ data, with collocated satellite data to be used in the evaluation and improvement of global flux products; organized intercom-parison projects, to evaluate and improve bulk flux models and determination from the satellite of the input parameters; and coordinated evaluation of the flux products in the context of applications, such as forcing ocean models and evaluation of coupled atmosphere-ocean models. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the status of global ocean surface flux products, the methodology being used by SEAFLUX, and the prospects for improvement of satellite-derived flux products.},

  Abstract                 = {Near-inertial internal waves (NIW) excited by storms and cyclones play an essential role in driving turbulent mixing in the thermocline and interior ocean. Storm-induced mixing may be climatically relevant in regions like the thermocline ridge in the southwestern Indian Ocean, where a shallow thermocline and strong high frequency wind activity enhance the impact of internal gravity wave-induced mixing on sea surface temperature. The Cirene research cruise in early 2007 collected ship-borne and mooring vertical profiles in this region under the effect of a developing tropical cyclone. In this paper, we characterize the NIW field and the impact of these waves on turbulent mixing in the upper ocean. NIW packets were identified down to 1000âm, the maximum depth of the measurements. We estimated an NIW vertical energy flux of up to 2.5âmWâmâ2 within the pycnocline, which represents about 10% of the maximum local wind power input. A non-negligible fraction of the wind power input is hence potentially available for subsurface mixing. The impact of mixing by internal waves on the upper ocean heat budget was estimated from a fine-scale mixing parameterization. During the first leg of the cruise (characterized by little NIW activity), the average heating rate due to mixing was ~0.06â$\,^{\circ}$Câmonthâ1 in the thermocline (23--24âkgâmâ3 isopycnals). During the second leg, characterized by strong NIW energy in the thermocline and below, this heating rate increased to 0.42â$\,^{\circ}$Câmonthâ1, indicative of increased shear instability along near inertial wave energy pathways.},

  abstract = {We investigate the causes of the seasonal cycle of the near-surface salinity using a mixed-layer salinity model and a combination of satellite products, atmospheric reanalyses, and in situ observations for the period 2000-2008, in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. We find that the balance differs from one region to another. In the western tropical Atlantic, it is controlled by horizontal advection from March to November and by freshwater flux and entrainment for the rest of the year. In the central tropical Atlantic, it is mainly due to the strong contribution of precipitation in agreement with previous results. In the northeastern tropical Atlantic, all terms contribute to the mixed layer salinity between December and March; during the rest of the year, precipitation and zonal advection mainly control the balance. In the Gulf of Guinea, it is driven by freshwater flux from October to February; from March to July, it is controlled by horizontal advection and entrainment; from August to September, mixed-layer salinity variability is weak. Finally, in the Congo region, it is driven by freshwater flux (precipitation and runoff from Congo River) from September to December, by horizontal advection during January to March, and by vertical entrainment during the rest of the year (April to August). There are some discrepancies between observed and modeled salinity tendencies. Some of them are due to our model formulation, which does not explicitly account for the effect of vertical diffusion. Uncertainties of observation products, which force the model, are also sources of errors.},

The boreal spring SSS maximum is mainly explained by an upward flux of high salinity originating from the core of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) through vertical mixing and advection. The vertical mixing contribution to the mixed-layer salt budget peaks in April--May. It is controlled primarily by (i) an increased zonal shear between the surface South Equatorial Current and the subsurface EUC and (ii) the presence of a strong salinity stratification at the mixed-layer base from December to May. This haline stratification that is due to both high precipitations below the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone and zonal advection of low-salinity water from the Gulf of Guinea explains largely the seasonal cycle of the vertical advection contribution to the mixed-layer salt budget. In the ACT region, the SST reaches its maximum in March/April and minimum in July/August. This SST minimum appears 1 month after the maximum of SSS. The 1 month lag observed between the maximum of SSS in June and the minimum of SST in July is explained by the shallowing of the EUC salinity core in June, then the weakening/erosion of the EUC in June--July which dramatically reduces the lateral subsurface supply of high-saline waters.},

Since its launch in November 2009, SMOS images are strongly impacted by radio frequency interference (RFI). So far RFI sources distributed worldwide have been detected. Up to 42% of these RFIs could be suppressed thanks to the co-operation of the National Spectrum Management Authorities. Some of the strongest RFI sources might mask other weaker sources underneath, hence it is expected the total number of RFI detected may increase as strong ones are progressively identified and switched off. Most RFIs are located in Asia and Europe, which together hold ~73% of the active sources and of the strongest interference. The areas affected by RFI may experience either an underestimation in the retrieved values of soil moisture and ocean salinity or data loss, with the associated detrimental impact on the scientific return. ESA and the teams participating in SMOS mission have put in place different strategies to alleviate this RFI situation.},

Available new gauge records are added to a network of gauges that covers ?80 ? 106 km2 or ?80% of global ocean-draining land areas and accounts for about 73% of global total runoff. For most of the large rivers, the record for 1948?2004 is fairly complete. Data gaps in the records are filled through linear regression using streamflow simulated by a land surface model [Community Land Model, version 3 (CLM3)] forced with observed precipitation and other atmospheric forcings that are significantly (and often strongly) correlated with the observed streamflow for most rivers. Compared with previous studies, the new dataset has improved homogeneity and enables more reliable assessments of decadal and long-term changes in continental freshwater discharge into the oceans. The model-simulated runoff ratio over drainage areas with and without gauge records is used to estimate the contribution from the areas not monitored by the gauges in deriving the total discharge into the global oceans. Results reveal large variations in yearly streamflow for most of the world?s large rivers and for continental discharge, but only about one-third of the top 200 rivers (including the Congo, Mississippi, Yenisey, ParanÃ¡, Ganges, Columbia, Uruguay, and Niger) show statistically significant trends during 1948?2004, with the rivers having downward trends (45) outnumbering those with upward trends (19). The interannual variations are correlated with the El NiÃ±o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events for discharge into the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and global ocean as a whole. For ocean basins other than the Arctic, and for the global ocean as a whole, the discharge data show small or downward trends, which are statistically significant for the Pacific (?9.4 km3 yr?1). Precipitation is a major driver for the discharge trends and large interannual-to-decadal variations. Comparisons with the CLM3 simulation suggest that direct human influence on annual streamflow is likely small compared with climatic forcing during 1948?2004 for most of the world?s major rivers. For the Arctic drainage areas, upward trends in streamflow are not accompanied by increasing precipitation, especially over Siberia, based on available data, although recent surface warming and associated downward trends in snow cover and soil ice content over the northern high latitudes contribute to increased runoff in these regions. The results are qualitatively consistent with climate model projections but contradict an earlier report of increasing continental runoff during the recent decades based on limited records.

Comparisons with the CLM3 simulation suggest that direct human influence on annual streamflow is likely small compared with climatic forcing during 1948?2004 for most of the world?s major rivers. For the Arctic drainage areas, upward trends in streamflow are not accompanied by increasing precipitation, especially over Siberia, based on available data, although recent surface warming and associated downward trends in snow cover and soil ice content over the northern high latitudes contribute to increased runoff in these regions. The results are qualitatively consistent with climate model projections but contradict an earlier report of increasing continental runoff during the recent decades based on limited records.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Annual and monthly mean values of continental freshwater discharge into the oceans are estimated at 1Â° resolution using several methods. The most accurate estimate is based on streamflow data from the world's largest 921 rivers, supplemented with estimates of discharge from unmonitored areas based on the ratios of runoff and drainage area between the unmonitored and monitored regions. Simulations using a river transport model (RTM) forced by a runoff field were used to derive the river mouth outflow from the farthest downstream gauge records. Separate estimates are also made using RTM simulations forced by three different runoff fields: 1) based on observed streamflow and a water balance model, and from estimates of precipitation P minus evaporation E computed as residuals from the atmospheric moisture budget using atmospheric reanalyses from 2) the National Centers for Environmental Prediction?National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP?NCAR) and 3) the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Compared with previous estimates, improvements are made in extending observed discharge downstream to the river mouth, in accounting for the unmonitored streamflow, in discharging runoff at correct locations, and in providing an annual cycle of continental discharge. The use of river mouth outflow increases the global continental discharge by ?19% compared with unadjusted streamflow from the farthest downstream stations. The river-based estimate of global continental discharge presented here is 37?288 Â± 662 km3 yr?1, which is ?7.6% of global P or 35% of terrestrial P. While this number is comparable to earlier estimates, its partitioning into individual oceans and its latitudinal distribution differ from earlier studies. The peak discharges into the Arctic, the Pacific, and global oceans occur in June, versus May for the Atlantic and August for the Indian Oceans. Snow accumulation and melt are shown to have large effects on the annual cycle of discharge into all ocean basins except for the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The discharge and its latitudinal distribution implied by the observation-based runoff and the ECMWF reanalysis-based P?E agree well with the river-based estimates, whereas the discharge implied by the NCEP?NCAR reanalysis-based P?E has a negative bias.

The experiments were compared to solar emission intensity data, the state of the atmosphere and wave parameters.

The ERA-Interim project was conducted in part to prepare for a new atmospheric reanalysis to replace ERA-40, which will extend back to the early part of the twentieth century. This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF. Copyright Â© 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

These tracks extend from New Zealand to Japan, from New Zealand to Hawaii, from Tahiti to California, and from Tahiti to Panama. They cross the equator at 155Â°E, 160Â°W, 140Â°W, and 100Â°W, respectively. Along each track, the mean SSS distribution is characterized by SSS minima which are 4Â°â6Â° further poleward than the axes of maximum precipitation associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). It is suggested that these SSS minima owe their existence mainly to heavy rainfall and poleward Ekman salt transport associated with the trade winds. The role of zonal salt advection was found negligible for these SSS minima. Except along the eastern track, maximum seasonal SSS variations are located in the ITCZ and SPCZ regions, with minimum SSS in September-October and March-April, respectively. On the basis of precipitation island stations, it is demonstrated that the maximum seasonal SSS variations are closely related to the rainfall regimes of the ITCZ and SPCZ (rainfall maximum 3 months before SSS minimum; rainfall amount sufficient to account for SSS changes). Along the eastern track, a strong annual SSS cycle is found from about 4Â°S (110Â°W) to the Panama coast (minimum SSS in FebruaryâMarch), reflecting the combined effects of rainfall, salt advection, and vertical mixing. Notable interannual SSS variability concerns only the western half of the tropical Pacific Ocean where El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related SSS changes are strongly related to ENSO-related precipitation changes. During ENSO periods, the SSS field west of about 150Â°W is characterized by fresher-than-average SSS within about 8Â°N to 8Â°S, and conversely saltier-than-average SSS poleward of 8Â° latitudes. These modifications in the SSS field are thought to result mainly from an eastward displacement in the ascending branch of the Walker and Hadley cells which induces unusually high rainfall over the western and central equatorial Pacific region bordered on all sides by rainfall deficits. Reproducing the actual SSS changes at seasonal and interannual time scales would be a very stringent test for model capability.},

  Abstract                 = {Monthly sea-surface salinity (SSS) and precipitation (P) in the tropical Pacific region are examined for the 1974-1989 period. The SSS data are derived mainly from water sample measurements obtained from a ship-of-opportunity program, and the rainfall data are derived from satellite observations of outgoing longwave radiation. The mean and standard deviation patterns of SSS and P exhibit good correspondence in the heavy-rainfall regions characterising the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and part of the western Pacific warm pool. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis indicates two dominant modes of variation linking P and SSS changes, one mode at the seasonal timescale in both convergence zones, and the other at the ENSO timescale in the central-western equatorial Pacific (165Â°E-160Â°W) and in the SPCZ. The inferences derived from the EOF analysis are used in a simple linear regression model in order to try to specify P changes from known SSS changes. A comparison between hindcast and observed P changes suggests that, at seasonal and ENSO timescales, SSS changes could be used to infer the timing, but not the magnitude, of P in the central-western equatorial Pacific (165Â°E-160Â°W) and in the SPCZ mean area. The effects of evaporation, salt advection and mixed-layer depth on the results are discussed.},

  abstract = {The role of the Yangtze River discharge in changing sea-surface salinity (SSS) in the East China Sea during the 1997-2001 periods is investigated by using (1) in situ SSS measurements along a merchant ship track running from Taiwan strait to Korea strait, (2) ocean general circulation model (OGCM) simulations and specific sensitivity studies, and (3) in land precipitation data to infer estimates of the river discharge in absence of gauged station data. The river effects on 1997-2001 sea surface temperature (SST) and surface currents are also examined. Both in situ SSS-SST measurements and OGCM simulations clearly indicate that the integration of the 1997 drought signal and 1998-1999 flooding signal over the catchment area of the Yangtze River are manifest in the ocean where local precipitation played a rather modest role. Sensitivity studies with the OGCM with and without the river discharge further reveal that these signals can extend over several hundred kilometers off the river mouth, consistent with the along track in situ measurements. In particular, SSS along the ship track can drop from about 34 psu in August 1997 to less than 26 psu in July 1998 (almost the same for 1999) at the latitude of the river mouth although located 500 km to the west of the ship track. Model results indicate that the dynamic and thermodynamic effects of the freshwater input from the river may be phase lagged by up to a season with maximum surface warming occurring in the summer months when the river discharge is maximum whereas the largest differences in mixed layers with and without the river input occur during later winter and late autumn. The possible positive feedback between the increase of river runoff yielding warm SST anomaly off the river mouth and so enhanced atmospheric convection and precipitation is discussed.},

We confine our discussion here to acoustic and electromagnetic problems, and limit the surface description to vertical height h and one or two horizontal scales L. Practical problems in manufacturing or measuring surfaces can include and often completely depend upon topics such as ripples, polishing marks, and behavior of surface extrema. We thus limit our consideration to acoustic and electromagnetic scattering from surfaces with vertical scales kh (k = 2pi/l)) and horizontal scales kL or tangent scales h/L. This is broad enough to discuss scattering from sea surfaces, terrain, atomic systems, and nanoscale roughness, as well as both deterministic and random problems characterizing the surface behavior.},

  abstract = {Immediately after formation, warm and cold Gulf Stream rings are visible in satellite infrared images of sea-surface temperature (SST) as pools of anomalous water. It is now well documented that the surface expressions of cold core rings quickly disappear, while warm rings, summertime excepted, remain visible to satellite infrared sensors throughout their lifetimes. From \{XBT\} data, one sees evidence of strong air-sea exchange and deep mixed layers in warm rings, but no unusual mixed layer development in cold rings. We apply a simple one-dimensional annual mixed layer model to Gulf Stream rings to explain these phenomena. The key ingredients of the model are the different atmospheric states over the Sargasso Sea and the Slope Water, the relative density structures of warm and cold rings, and the difference in mixed layer response to heating and cooling. Several features of the surface water behavior in warm and cold rings are qualitatively reflected in the model results. Quantitative comparisons between model predictions and observations are also encouraging, suggesting that the \{SST\} evolution of a ring can be attributed to local air-sea exchange.},

This variability is caused by solar, meteorological, and other physical forcing as well as biological and chemical processes that affect optical properties and their distributions, which in turn control the propagation of light across the air-sea interface and within the upper ocean. Recent developments in several technologies and modeling capabilities have enabled the investigation of a variety of fundamental and applied problems related to upper ocean physics, chemistry, and light propagation and utilization in the dynamic near-surface ocean. The purpose here is to provide background for and an introduction to a collection of papers devoted to new technologies and observational results as well as model simulations, which are facilitating new insights into optical variability and light propagation in the ocean as they are affected by changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions.},

In most cases, radiation from the Moon is negligible; however, at several times during the lunar cycle, it is possible for radiation to be reflected from the Earth's surface into the main beam of the radiometer antennas. The signal in such cases can be important because of the high radiometric accuracy required to monitor salinity. Examples are presented using the Aquarius orbit and antennas for both smooth and rough ocean surfaces.},

Taking into account the influence of the various fetch conditions encountered during these campaigns, we study the influence of the <span class='snippet'>sea</span> state on emissivity. We use <span class='snippet'>sea</span> state measurements to estimate the wave age. Then we use a <span class='snippet'>sea</span> wave spectrum, which is wave age dependent, to compute brightness temperatures (Tb) with a two-scale emissivity model. We compare the simulated Tb with measurements and determine the validity of the <span class='snippet'>sea</span> state parameterization.},

  Abstract                 = {Spaceborne radiometric measurements at L-band from the Aquarius instrument are compared to numerical model simulation. A calibration bias is estimated: of the order of 3K to 5K in vertical polarization, and of the order of 1.5 K or less in horizontal polarization. A bias temporal drift of about 1 K over five months is identified for all beams and polarizations. Measurements/model comparisons are also performed to assess the uncertainty of various aspects of the data processing that are critical for retrieving Sea Surface Salinity, such as the correction for Faraday rotation and the impact of sea surface roughness on the surface signal. Errors in the antenna pattern models are identified, that lead to significant biases in Faraday rotation angle. The precision of the model for surface roughness impact is estimated to be of the order of 0.25K over a large range of wind speeds, but is less accurate at the low and high end of the wind speed range, particularly for wind speeds much larger than 15 m/s.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new Sea surface temperature (SST) analysis that is produced with global coverage on a daily basis at the Met Office called the Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system. OSTIA uses satellite SST data provided by international agencies via the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework. GHRSST products include data from microwave and infrared satellite instruments with accompanying uncertainty estimates. The system also uses in situ SST data available over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and a sea-ice concentration product from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Applications Facility (OSI-SAF). The SST analysis is a multi-scale optimal interpolation that is designed for applications in numerical weather prediction and ocean forecasting systems. The background error covariance matrix is specified using ocean model data and the analysis uses correlation length scales of 1km and 100km. The OSTIA system produces a foundation SST estimate (SSTfnd, which is the SST free of diurnal variability) at an output grid resolution of 1/20\B0 (6km) although the smallest analysis feature resolution is based on the correlation length scale of 10km. All satellite SST data are adjusted for bias errors based on a combination of ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data and in situ SST measurements from drifting buoys. Data are filtered (based on surface wind speed data) to remove diurnal variability and AATSR data are adjusted to represent the SST at the same depth as drifting buoy measurements (0.2m) before bias adjustments are made. Global coverage outputs are provided each day in GHRSST L4 netCDF format. A variety of secondary products are also provided including weekly and monthly mean data sets. OSTIA products are continuously monitored and validation/verification activities demonstrate that SST products have zero mean bias and an accuracy of 0.57K compared to in situ measurements. OSTIA is now used operationally as a boundary condition for all weather forecast models at the Met Office and at European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). OSTIA is produced by the Met Office as part of the European Union Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) MyOcean project.},

  Abstract                 = {A series of airborne scatterometer experiments designed to collect C and Ku band ocean backscatter data in regions of high ocean surface winds has recently been completed. More than 100 hours of data were collected using the University of Massachusetts C and Ku band scatterometers, CSCAT and KUSCAT. These instruments measure the full azimuthal normalized radar cross section (NRCS) of a common surface area of the ocean simultaneously at four incidence angles. Our results demonstrate limitations of the current empirical models, C band geophysical model function 4 (CMOD4), SeaSat scatterometer 2 (SASS 2), and NASA scatterometer 1 (NSCAT) 1, that relate ocean backscatter to the near-surface wind at high wind speeds. The discussion focuses on winds in excess of 15 m sâ1 in clear atmospheric conditions. The scatterometer data are collocated with measurements from ocean data buoys and Global Positioning System dropsondes, and a Fourier analysis is performed as a function of wind regime. A three-term Fourier series is fit to the backscatter data, and a revised set of coefficients is tabulated. These revised models, CMOD4HW and KUSCAT 1, are the basis for a discussion of the NRCS at high wind speeds. Our scatterometer data show a clear overprediction of the derived NRCS response to high winds based on the CMOD4, SASS 2, and NSCAT 1 models. Furthermore, saturation of the NRCS response begins to occur above 15 m sâ1. Sensitivity of the upwind and crosswind response is discussed with implications toward high wind speed retrieval.},

  abstract = {We validate Aquarius sea surface salinities against Argo 1-7 m salinities for the period 27 August 2011 through 1 October 2013, a period of â¼25 months. The validation consists of comparison of 20,149 collocated Argo/Aquarius data pairs. The global mean of the difference between Aquarius and Argo salinities is +0.018 PSU, with latitudinal variations of approximately Â±0.2 PSU. The standard deviation of this difference ranges from about 0.3 PSU in the tropics to 0.7 PSU at high latitudes. We discuss errors due to geographic and temporal displacement and depth of measurement and show that these are insignificant for global validation of Aquarius. In particular, we use NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B42 product to analyze the contribution of vertical salinity stratification in the ocean to validation error. This salinity stratification is important for understanding the hydrological cycle of the oceans and has been cited as a potential source of error in validation of satellite-based sea surface salinity because of the â¼1-7 m minimum depth of most Argo profiles. We show evidence of heavy precipitation events causing stratification greater than 0.1 PSU and lasting â¼2-8 h, but note that these events occur infrequently and contribute less than 0.03 PSU bias in the tropics and 0.025 PSU globally. It is demonstrated that the existing global Argo array provides sufficient data for large-scale validation of Aquarius sea surface salinity. We also discuss the potential to exploit large salinity gradients in the upper mixed layer as a signature of rain in the tropical ocean.},

  abstract = {We investigate the processes responsible for the intraseasonal displacements of the eastern edge of the western Pacific warm pool (WPEE), which appear to play a role in the onset and development of El Nino events. We use 25 years of output from an ocean general circulation model experiment that is able to accurately capture the observed displacements of the WPEE, sea level anomalies, and upper ocean zonal currents at intraseasonal time scales in the western and central Pacific Ocean. Our results confirm that WPEE displacements driven by westerly wind events (WWEs) are largely controlled by zonal advection. This paper has also two novel findings: first, the zonal current anomalies responsible for the WPEE advection are driven primarily by local wind stress anomalies and not by intraseasonal wind-forced Kelvin waves as has been shown in most previous studies. Second, we find that intraseasonal WPEE fluctuations that are not related to WWEs are generally caused by intraseasonal variations in net heat flux, in contrast to interannual WPEE displacements that are largely driven by zonal advection. This study hence raises an interesting question: can surface heat flux-induced zonal WPEE motions contribute to El Nino Southern Oscillation evolution, as WWEs have been shown to be able to do?},

  abstract = {Observations from 35 tropical moorings are used to characterize the diurnal cycle in salinity at 1-m depth. The amplitude of diurnal salinity anomalies is up to 0.01 psu and more typically ~0.005 psu. Diurnal variations in precipitation and vertical entrainment appear to be the dominant drivers of diurnal salinity variability, with evaporation also contributing. Areas where these processes are strong are expected to have relatively strong salinity cycles: the eastern Atlantic and Pacific equatorial regions, the southwestern Bay of Bengal, the Amazon outflow region, and the Indo-Pacific warm pool. We hypothesize that salinity anomalies resulting from precipitation and evaporation are initially trapped very near the surface and may not be observed at the 1-m instrument depths until they are mixed downward. As a result, the pattern of diurnal salinity variations is not only dependent on the strength of the forcing terms, but also on the phasing of winds and convective overturning. A comparison of mixed-layer depth computed with hourly and with daily-averaged salinity reveals that diurnal salinity variability can have a significant effect on upper-ocean stratification, suggesting that representing diurnal salinity variability could potentially improve air-sea interaction in climate models. Comparisons between salinity observations from moorings and from the Aquarius satellite (level 2 version 2.5.1 data) reveal that the typical difference between ascending-node and descending-node Aquarius salinity is an order of magnitude greater than the observed diurnal salinity anomalies at 1-m depth.},

  Abstract                 = {This study focuses on the improved estimation of mesoscale surface ocean circulation obtained by merging TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) and ERS-1 and -2 altimeter measurements between October 1992 and May 1998. Once carefully intercalibrated and homogenized, these data are merged through an advanced global objective analysis method that allows us to correct for residual long wavelength errors and uses realistic correlation scales of ocean dynamics. The high-resolution (0.25Â°Ã0.25Â°) merged T/P+ERS-1 and -2 sea level anomaly maps provide more homogeneous and reduced mapping errors than either individual data set and more realistic sea level and geostrophic velocity statistics than T/P data alone. Furthermore, the merged T/P+ERS-1 and -2 maps yield eddy kinetic energy (EKE) levels 30% higher than maps of T/P alone. They also permit realistic global estimates of east and north components of EKE and their seasonal variations, to study EKE sources better. A comparison of velocity statistics with World Ocean Circulation Experiment surface drifters in the North Atlantic shows very good agreement. Comparison with contemporary current meter data in various oceanic regimes also produces comparable levels of energy and similar ratios of northward and eastward energy, showing that the maps are suitable to studying anisotropy. The T/P + ERS zonal and meridional components of the mapped currents usually present comparable rms variability, even though the variability in the Atlantic is more isotropic than that in the Pacific, which exhibits strong zonal changes. The EKE map presents a very detailed description, presumably never before achieved at a global scale. Pronounced seasonal changes of the EKE are found in many regions, notably the northeastern Pacific, the northeastern and northwestern Atlantic, the tropical oceans, and the zonally extended bands centered near 20Â°S in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans and at 20Â°N in the northwestern Pacific.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous measurements of Doppler spectra in microwave backscattering in a wind wave tank at 9.375 GHz and 23.9 GHz have been extended to 70.1 GHz at 3 m fetch and to longer fetches and higher winds at the two lower microwave frequencies. At high depression angles, the scatterers appear to be specular points moving at approximately the speed of the dominant wind wave. At lower depression angles, the scatterers can be thought of as comprising systems which are respectively bound to and free of the dominant wave. The free scatterers are low-order Bragg scatterers and it is natural to treat them as free waves or free wave systems in their own right. The bound scatterers are the familiar parasitic capillary waves at low winds, but at higher winds they appear to be associated with the breaking water at the crest of the dominant wave.},

  abstract = {The long-term evolution of initially Gaussian eddies is studied in a reduced-gravity shallow-water model using both linear and nonlinear quasigeostrophic theory in an attempt to understand westward-propagating mesoscale eddies observed and tracked by satellite altimetry. By examining both isolated eddies and a large basin seeded with eddies with statistical characteristics consistent with those of observed eddies, it is shown that long-term eddy coherence and the zonal wavenumber-frequency power spectral density are best matched by the nonlinear model. Individual characteristics of the eddies including amplitude decay, horizontal length scale decay, and zonal and meridional propagation speed of a previously unrecognized quasi-stable state are examined. The results show that the meridional deflections from purely westward flow (poleward for cyclones and equatorward for anticyclones) are consistent with satellite observations. Examination of the fluid transport properties of the eddies shows that an inner core of the eddy, defined by the zero relative vorticity contour, contains only fluid from the eddy origin, whereas a surrounding outer ring contains a mixture of ambient fluid from throughout the eddyâs lifetime.},

Because of their short time scale, WWBs are normally considered part of a stochastic forcing of ENSO, completely external to the interannual ENSO variability. Recent observational studies, however, suggest that the occurrence and characteristics of WWBs may depend to some extent on the state of ENSO components, implying that WWBs, which force ENSO, are modulated by ENSO itself. Satellite and in situ observations are used here to show that WWBs are significantly more likely to occur when the warm pool is extended eastward. Based on these observations, WWBs are added to an intermediate complexity coupled ocean?atmosphere ENSO model. The representation of WWBs is idealized such that their occurrence is modulated by the warm pool extent. The resulting model run is compared with a run in which the WWBs are stochastically applied. The modulation of WWBs by ENSO results in an enhancement of the slow frequency component of the WWBs. This causes the amplitude of ENSO events forced by modulated WWBs to be twice as large as the amplitude of ENSO events forced by stochastic WWBs with the same amplitude and average frequency. Based on this result, it is suggested that the modulation of WWBs by the equatorial Pacific SST is a critical element of ENSO?s dynamics, and that WWBs should not be regarded as purely stochastic forcing. In the paradigm proposed here, WWBs are still an important aspect of ENSO?s dynamics, but they are treated as being partially stochastic and partially affected by the large-scale ENSO dynamics, rather than being completely external to ENSO. It is further shown that WWB modulation by the large-scale equatorial SST field is roughly equivalent to an increase in the ocean?atmosphere coupling strength, making the coupled equatorial Pacific effectively self-sustained.

It was primarily developed using brightness temperature observations during hurricanes with coincident high-quality surface-truth wind speeds, which were obtained using the airborne Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer. Also, other ocean emissivity models available through the published literature and the spaceborne WindSat radiometer measurements were used.},

The full wave double scatter cross sections are expressed in terms of six dimensional integrals. The cpu time needed to evaluate the six dimensional integrals using standard techniques is excessive even for supercomputers. A numerical technique is used to reduce the six dimensional integrals into three dimensional integrals (one dimensional integral calling two independent two dimensional integrals). These two dimensional integrals account for the correlations between the heights and slopes at two points on the surface. The results exhibit the observed sharp enhanced backscatter and the polarization dependence of the cross sections. The angular width and the magnitude of the enhanced backscatter depend on the rough surface parameters (mean square height and slope)},

Furthermore, simplified reduced equations are developed for the fashion in which the vortical waves influence the gravity waves through averaging over specific gravity wave/vortical resonances.},

  abstract = {The present computation of sea surface temperature (SST) from infrared satellite measurements requires a coincident sample of in situ (drifting buoy and/or ship) SST measurements, to compute by regression the algorithmic coefficients for the infrared data. Ignoring the fundamental difference between satellite-measured âskin SSTâ and buoy/ship measured âbulk SST,â we analyze past buoy and ship SST data to better evaluate the errors involved in the routine computation of SST from operational satellite data. We use buoy and ship SST data for 2 years (1990 and 1996) from the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set as well as 2 years of previously cloud-cleared satellite radiances with matching drifting/moored buoy SST data from the NASA Pathfinder SST data set. We examine the in situ SST data for geographic distribution, accuracy, and self-consistency. We find that there are large geographic regions that are frequently not sampled by the present drifting buoy network, a natural consequence of the fact that most buoys are not deployed to measure in situ SST for satellite infrared SST calibration. Comparisons between drifting buoy SSTs suggest an error of â¼0.4Â°C for nearly coincident buoy SSTs. Comparing moored with adjacent drifting buoy SSTs, we find that drifting and moored buoy SSTs are samples from the same population. Ship SSTs are noisier and have a significant warm bias relative to drifting buoy SSTs. We explore the SST measurement accuracy changes that occur with variations in sampling coverage used for the SST algorithm regression. We both vary the total amount of points and restrict the regression data to regional sampling biases. Surprisingly the total number of calibration SST values can be quite small if they cover all latitudes. We conclude that buoy SSTs can have residual bias errors of â¼0.15Â°C with RMS errors closer to 0.5Â°C.},

  Abstract                 = {Using cross correlations between sequential infrared satellite images, an objective technique is developed to compute advective sea surface velocities. Cross correlations are computed in 32 Ã 32 pixel search (second image) and 22 Ã 22 template (first image) windows from gradients of sea surface temperature computed from the satellite images. Velocity vectors, computed from sequential images of the British Columbia coastal ocean, generally appear coherent and consistent with the seasonal surface current in the region. During periods of strong wind forcing, as indicated by maps of sea level pressure, the image advective velocities are stronger and more coherent spatially and appear to cross surface temperature gradients; when winds are weaker, the advective velocities correspond better with the infrared temperature patterns, suggesting the increased contribution of the geostrophic current to the surface flow. Velocities determined from coincident, near-surface drogued (5â10 m) buoys, positioned every half hour by internal LORAN-C units in mid-June, show excellent agreement with the image advective velocities. In addition, conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) measurements (taken during the buoy tracking) confirm the homogeneity of the upper 10 m, and CTD-derived geostrophic currents are consistent with both buoy and sequential image displacement velocities.},

  Abstract                 = {{Curvature effects in EM scattering from ocean surface are described using a generalized curvature expansion of the fields at an elevated nonperfect conducting surface. The new expansion formalism allows us to describe analytically and in general, without separating into different scales, the scattering of EM waves from an undulated ocean surface. The model is exact to first order in curvature for nonshadowing imaging geometry, and obeys the law of reciprocity and tilt invariance. Explicit expressions for EM fields at the surface, including both the projection and the self induced fields, are derived up to first order in surface curvature. Analytic closed form expressions for the scattered fields are derived from the surface field solutions, and applied to the case of backscattering, providing a general expression for the normalized radar cross section. The analytic expression for the normalized radar cross section is implemented for a linear surface model using both the Eulerian and the Lagrangian frame of reference. The results show that the model is capable of describing the expected dependency on polarization, incidence angle, and wind field with minimal restrictions in terms of range of validity. Comparison of polarization ratio shows good agreement between the model and measurements from the Envisat ASAR instrument.}},

  Abstract                 = {Image cross-spectra obtained by combining pairs of single look SAR images are utilized in an inversion scheme for extracting the underlying ocean wave spectrum. The reasons for proposing the use of image cross-spectra instead of standard multilook spectra are twofold. First, the image cross-spectra are shown to significantly reduce the speckle noise level while preserving the spectral shape. Second, the image cross-spectra provide information about the wave propagation direction. A closed form expression of the ocean-to-SAR spectral transform and its inversion is formulated for the cross-spectral case. The inversion method is based on computing the full derivative of the nonlinear ocean-to-SAR image cross-spectral transform. The SAR image cross-spectra are shown to yield a SNR typically 16-25 dB higher than the corresponding standard 3 look image spectra. The noise level is typically reduced with a factor of 20 compared to the 3 look spectra and a factor of 60 compared to the single look spectra.

  Abstract                 = {An algorithm that extracts the directional ocean wave spectrum from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ocean image spectra is implemented and applied to spaceborne C-band SAR data obtained from the ERS-1 satellite. The nonlinear iterative algorithm is based on the Hasselmann's forward spectral transform extended to include the range bunching effect. An analytic expression for the wave spectral increment is derived based on the exact gradient of the quasilinear ocean-to-SAR transform. Enhanced wave spectra have been obtained using first-guess wave spectra either from the numerical wave model WINCH operated by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute or synthesized from nondirectional wave data and meteorological conditions. The inverted spectra are compared to in situ directional wave data. It is concluded that the wave imagery from ERS-1 appears to be of excellent quality, and as soon as the backscatter modulation transfer functions are properly understood, satellite SAR data will be an important tool for enhancing and extending conventional wave measurements and results from numerical wave models},

Four five-metre trihedral corner reflectors and three smaller dihedral reflectors were deployed and operated during eight months. 23 PALSAR scenes were acquired over the calibration site allowing an evaluation of the quality and temporal stability of the data. Results show that the co-polarized data have been stable during the whole calibration period with variations in the trihedral responses lower than 0.7 dB. The measured resolution in azimuth was 4.4 m and in slant range 4.7 m for single polarization images and 9.5 m for polarimetric data. For the cross-polarized data large variations in the dihedral responses were found. It is assumed that this is caused by a larger sensitivity to pointing errors. For the polarimetric data, estimation of Faraday rotation gave values ranging from 0.1deg to 3deg.},

The effect of foam is certainly small. During the WISE 2001 field experiment carried on an oil rig, we studied this dependence at low wind speed, finding an abrupt decrease of the wind speed effect on the brightness temperature below 3 m middot;s-1.},

  Abstract                 = {A chronology constructed from satellite-derived thermal imagery is presented to describe the formation and life history of warm-core ring 82B. This overview provides insight into a classification of features and discrete events associated with Gulf Stream warm-core rings and allows these events, as well as our limited shipboard observations, to be placed in a broader spatial and temporal context than would otherwise be possible without the satellite data. Events influencing the evolution of 82B include environmental factors, such as meteorological influences and Gulf Stream interactions, as well as those stimulated by encounters with changes in bottom topography. The interactions of the ring with surrounding waters are especially noteworthy, and the existence of vortex-vortex interactions is shown to be a significant cause of local water advection through streamer activity. Ring events are documented by following changes in ring size, shape, translation, and surface thermal structure. Our satellite observations are supported by extensive contemporaneous shipboard observations, including XBT, CTD, BOPS (biooptical profiling system) temperature profiles, and along-track sea surface temperature measurements. In addition, acoustic velocity profiling and drifter trajectories have been used to corroborate hydrographic features of the ring and environs. These ship and satellite data form a coherent space/time overview of the ring and its environment and show them to be closely related and continually interacting.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, with the availability of a great number of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wave mode spectra, it has been possible to derive a set of great circle lines of swell propagation whose intersection points indicate the position of the storm generating the observed swell field. However, due to the inherent limitations of SAR spectra, the locus of convergence of great circle of swell propagation can be sometimes diffuse or contain multiple convergence regions. In this letter, we adapted the fuzzy cluster logic method to identify the regions of convergence of SAR wave field rays. The analysis of the results of the fuzzy algorithm clearly indicates the ability of this statistical method to identify the cluster center region of swell fields observed in SAR wave mode images. The measure of success of the method was how well the generation center of the swell could be traced back to an existing strong storm system.},

In contrast, the response of the surface layer thickness is mainly restricted to lower than diurnal frequencies. A linear two-layer model with allowance for friction is used to show that frictional damping can account for the poor coupling at high frequencies. In fact the friction is sufficiently large to cause free modes to be critically damped (i.e., non-oscillatory). The model results compare favorably with the observations, using a frictional coefficient estimated from the decay of the internal tide.},

  Abstract                 = {During the past several years, research into the frontal divisions of the ocean has been particularly intensive. The significance of this lies not only in the fact that, in the five years from 1976 to 1980, more than 500 papers on this question were published in various journals throughout the world and at least three major international discussions were held (see p. 17). The newness of the discussion of the topic steins from the qualitative reinterpretation of the physical essence of the phenomenon and its role in the ocean, particularly in the processes of mixing and structure formation.While in the past the conventional view of fronts as boundaries between large-scale water masses of the ocean only led to the recognition of convenient classification limits created by nature itself, there is now a tendency to study oceanic fronts as integral elements of the dynamics of oceanic waters. As we understand it, fronts are being associated more and more with the dynamic and kinematic features which arise when kinetic energy and enstrophy are transmitted through a cascade of scales characterizing various forms of motion of a stratified medium in laterally confined oceanic basins. We are beginning to get a better understanding of the role synoptic-scale oceanic eddies play in the process of frontogenesis in the ocean. We are beginning to perceive the laws that govern the creation and destruction of fronts due to sudden disruption of the normal processes which match the response of the ocean to the fluxes of heat and buoyancy across the ocean/atmosphere boundary. We can no longer ignore the role of the Earth's rotation in the formation, maintenance and evolution of fronts, as well as in the development of instability at these fronts. Finally, we are turning to fronts as the most likely, and possibly the most effective mechanism for mixing and the transfer of heat and salt through the hydrostatically stable pycnocline. We no longer doubt that the link between the vertical finestructure of the ocean and mesoscale horizontal inhomogeneities inevitably involves fronts.},

  Abstract                 = {The main goal of this exploratory study is to determine how the temperature-salinity relationship changes with horizontal length scale and depth in the ocean. Temperature and salinity were measured on a range of scales from 4 m to 1000 km, towing a SeaSoar along isobars and isopycnals in the subtropical gyre of the North Pacific, during the winter of 1997. The wavelet transform technique is used to compute the horizontal density ratio and thermohaline variability as a function of scale and location. Measurements along an isobar in the mixed layer show that the horizontal density ratio is 1 at all scales observed; that is, horizontal temperature and salinity gradients tend to cancel each other in their effect on density. Thermohaline variability at small scales is intermittent and clusters around large-scale thermohaline anomalies. Below the base of the mixed layer, horizontal gradients of temperature are only partially opposed by salinity, and the density ratio is close to 2. In the thermocline the distribution of thermohaline variability is uniform along isobars but intermittent and colocated at different scales along isopycnals. Density-compensated variability, ubiquitous in the mixed layer, is reduced along deeper isopycnals. Compensation of horizontal temperature and salinity gradients supports recent theoretical ideas that mixing in the winter mixed layer depends on horizontal density gradients.},

  Abstract                 = {Interannual variability of sea surface salinity in the northwest tropical Atlantic is investigated in several ocean general circulation model eddy-permitting simulations using different air-sea freshwater forcing. The only simulation able to reproduce some features of the observed variability from 1989 to 1993, in particular in the northwest South American region up to 20Â°N, east of the Lesser Antilles, is one with no relaxation to a salinity climatology. The model variability results from advection of freshwater originating from the large South American continental shelf river runoff and has a seasonal cycle associated with the displacement of the intertropical convergence zone: Anomalies develop from March to May and then propagate to a larger area within the next months with the horizontal currents (where both geostrophic and Ekman currents contribute). Later on, from July to October, the anomalies are damped through entrainment across the mixed layer base. The vertical diffusion through the mixed layer base does not weaken when anomalously fresh surface water is present (i.e., no barrier layer effect). According to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA15 reanalysis, air-sea freshwater fluxes have little impact on the large (over 0.5 practical salinity scale) sea surface salinity (SSS) variability in this region. In the model, eddy variability plays little role in the interannual SSS variability, maybe because of inadequate resolution resulting in too weak and too few North Brazil Current eddies.},

  Abstract                 = {The sensitivity of a global thermodynamicâdynamic sea ice model coupled to a oneâdimensional upper ocean model to degradations of the model physics is investigated. The thermodynamic component of the sea ice model takes into consideration the presence of snow on top of sea ice, the storage of sensible and latent heat inside the snowâice system, the influence of the subgridâscale snow and ice thickness distributions on sea ice thermodynamics, the transformation of snow into snow ice when snow depth increases to the point where the snowâice interface sinks below the waterline, and the existence of leads and polynyas (areas of open water) within the ice cover. Ice dynamics is treated basically as by Hibler [1979]. Regarding the upper ocean model, it is made up of an integral mixed layer model and of a diffusive model of the pycnocline. Advection of heat and salt by oceanic currents is implicitly accounted for by restoring the temperatures and salinities of the water column to annual mean data. It is very important to note that a single set of parameter values is employed to simultaneously simulate the Arctic and Antarctic ice regimes. A control run carried out with the model demonstrates that it does reasonably well in simulating the seasonal waxing and waning of both ice packs. The sensitivity study focuses on physical processes pertaining to (1) the vertical growth and decay of sea ice (thermal inertia of snow and ice, heat conduction, and snow cover), (2) the lateral growth and decay of sea ice (leads and polynyas), and (3) the sea ice dynamics (ice motion and shear strength). A total of nine sensitivity experiments have been performed. Each experiment consisted of removing a particular parameterization from the control run computer code. It appears that the thermal inertia of the snowâice system is negligible in the Antarctic but not in the Arctic, where the total heat content of sea ice is chiefly dictated by internal storage of latent heat in brine pockets, sensible heat storage being of very minor consequence. It is also found that the inclusion of a prognostic snow layer and of a scheme of snow ice formation is important for sea ice modeling in the southern hemisphere. Furthermore, our results suggest that the thermodynamic effect of the subgridâscale snow and ice thickness distributions, the existence of open water areas within the ice cover, and the ice motion play a crucial role in determining the seasonal behavior of both ice packs. The ice shear strength seems to be of lesser importance, although it has a nonnegligible effect in both hemispheres.

Different versions of the error metric are invariant to different combinations of effects, including the image's (a) being multiplied by a real or complex-valued constant, (b) having a constant added to its phase, (c) being translated, or (d) being complex conjugated and rotated 180{\textdegree}. Invariance to these effects is particularly important for the phase-retrieval problem. One can also estimate the parameters of those effects. Similarly, two wave fronts can be compared, allowing for arbitrary constant (piston) and linear (tilt) phase terms. One can also include a weighting function. The relation between the error metric and other quality measures is derived.},

  Abstract                 = {Developments leading to the new practical salinity scale and equation of state for seawater, introduced by the Joint Panel on Oceanographic Tables and Standards (JPOTS), are reviewed. The laboratory measurements used to construct the new empirical formulas for converting conductivity ratios to salinity and for estimating seawater density from salinity, temperature, and pressure were made on samples of standard seawater to minimize the effects of compositional variations. Measured densities were fitted with a standard deviation of 0.0036 kg/m3 at atmospheric pressure and 0.009 kg/m3 over the oceanic pressure range. Natural seawater densities can differ from computed density by as much as 0.05 kg/m3 because of variations in the composition of dissolved salts that are not reflected equivalently in measured conductivity ratios. Differences from the previous Knudsen-Ekman equation of state are also of comparable magnitude. Values of specific volume anomaly for geopotential anomaly computations for estimation of geostrophic currents and transport are not significantly modified. Algorithms adopted by the JPOTS for computing adiabatic lapse rate and potential temperature are compared with formulas derived from the new equation of state. Potential temperatures agree within 2Ã10â3Â°C over the oceanic range of temperature and pressure at salinity of 35.},

  abstract = {In this study the causes of the seasonal cycle of mixed layer salinity in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean are investigated from a combination of satellite, atmospheric reanalysis, and in situ data sets. Results indicate that the salinity balance varies regionally, leading to a seasonal cycle in sea surface salinity (SSS) with significant spatial inhomogeneity. For example, horizontal salinity advection plays a key role in the salinity balance of the western tropical North Atlantic (10-25\B0N, 50-65\B0W), where seasonal variations in SSS are relatively large. In contrast, in the north-central basin (15-25\B0N, 20-50\B0W), freshening from meridional advection balances an excess of evaporation over precipitation, resulting in a very weak seasonal cycle of mixed layer salinity. Farther south (5-15\B0N, 20-45\B0W), seasonal variations of precipitation are more significant and drive a pronounced seasonal cycle of mixed layer salinity. Throughout most of the tropical North Atlantic the sum of the surface moisture flux and horizontal advection underestimates the mixed layer salinity tendency during boreal fall and winter. This is the time of year with highest wind speeds and highest negative buoyancy flux, suggesting that vertical turbulent entrainment of high-salinity thermocline water may be important. Daily measurements from a moored buoy in the central tropical North Atlantic are consistent with this interpretation. The results of this study highlight the complexity of the seasonal salinity balance in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean and the need for continued in situ monitoring of upper ocean salinity and currents to complement future space-based surface salinity measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {This article reports observations made in a sea coastal zone by an airborne X-band SAR. This zone includes a basin connected to the sea and the vicinity of the RhÃ´ne river estuary. We present the experiment and the data processing procedures including, in particular, a method for removing speckle effects from image spectra of waves. Observations of slick patterns in the basin are reported and used to relate their spatial distribution to features of the circulation as predicted by modelling. Then, we present the wave phenomena observed at sea. Off-shore, the observations are found to be consistent with actual wind conditions. Differences in wave visibility between the images are discussed using the ocean wave SAR imaging theory. The significant wave height is calculated from the image presenting the best geometry for wave detection. Along the coast, the wave transformations observed are discussed on the basis of the results of a simple wave model initialized by the main wave parameters measured off-shore. The complicated refraction effects predicted by the model can only be partially detected on the radar images because of the geometry of the observations. Finally, a frontal event is detected and interpreted as the signature of the boundary of the river plume. The wave-current model of Skop and Leipold (1988) explains the brightness of the radar signature of the front. Among other results, the conclusion emphasizes the good adequation of airborne SAR systems for remote sensing of the coastal environment.},

  abstract = {The recent use of along-track interferometry (ATI) in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has shown promise for synoptic measurement of ocean surface currents. ATI-SARs have been used to estimate wave fields, currents, and current features. This paper describes and analyzes a dual-beam along-track interferometer to provide spatially resolved vector surface velocity estimates with a single pass of an aircraft. The design employs a pair of interferometer beams, one squinted forward and one squinted aft. Each interferometric phase is sensitive to the component of surface Doppler velocity in the direction of the beam. Therefore, a proper combination of these measurements provides a vector surface velocity estimate in one pass of the aircraft. The authors find that precise measurements dictate widely spaced beams and that the spatial resolution for the squinted SAR is essentially identical to the sidelooking case. Practical instrument design issues are discussed, and an airborne system currently in development is described. Through computer simulation, they observe the azimuthal displacement of interferometric phases by moving surfaces identical to those of conventional SAR and find that such displacement can bias the estimated surface velocity},

  abstract = {A model for linearly polarized fully polarimetric backscatter measurements is used, incorporating the effects of system noise, channel amplitude, phase imbalance, crosstalk, and Faraday rotation. A step-by-step procedure is outlined for correction (or calibration) of fully polarimetric data subject to Faraday rotation, to recover the true scattering matrix. The procedure identifies steps for crosstalk removal and correction of channel imbalances that are robust in the presence of Faraday rotation. The final steps in the procedure involve a novel strategy for estimation and correction of Faraday rotation. Three approaches to estimate the (one-way) Faraday rotation angle Omega; directly from linear (quad-) polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter data obtained by a spaceborne SAR system are described. Each approach can initially be applied to the signature of any scatterer within the scene. Sensitivity analyses are presented that show that at least one of the measures can be used to estimate Omega; to within plusmn;3 deg; to 5 deg;, with reasonable levels of residual crosstalk, noise floor, channel amplitude, and phase imbalance. Ambiguities may be present in the estimates of Omega; of plusmn;n pi;/2 - the impact of this is discussed, and several approaches are suggested to deal with this possibility. The approach described in this paper is relevant for future L-band spaceborne SARs and removes one key obstacle to the deployment of even longer wavelength SARs (e.g., an ultrahigh frequency or P-band SAR) in Earth orbit.},

  Abstract                 = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Canadian RADARSAT satellite, along with infrared and visible data from operational weather satellites, is being collected over the ocean off the U.S. East, Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering <span class='snippet'>Sea</span> coasts. Mesoscale features observed in the SAR data are identified using coincident Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES) data to decide whether the signature is atmospheric or oceanic in origin. Combining the two data sources allows information in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) to be observed. This technique of feature detection using multiple data sets is referred to as data fusion. This paper focuses on a single storm event that is imaged by RADARSAT SAR in the Bering <span class='snippet'>Sea</span> on February 5, 1998 at 06:00 UTM. From the fusion of SAR and GOES data, frontal boundaries can be deciphered},

The ScanSAR mode on the Canadian satellite RADARSAT-1, with its 500 km swath width, is large enough to cover small storms such as polar lows. The HH polarization of RADARSAT-1 resolves atmospheric effects remarkably well. A data collection effort that began in the winter of 1997-98 was continued for 1998-1999. In total, eleven polar lows have been imaged. This paper examines a polar low imaged by SAR on October 24, 1998, which was not observed using other standard data. This storm was approximately 130 km wide and exhibited a very distinct eye},

  Abstract                 = {The particular problem of wave scattering at low grazing angles is of great interest because of its importance for the long-distance propagation of radio waves along the Earth's surface, radar observation of near surface objects, as well as solving many other fundamental and applied problems of remote sensing. One of the main questions is: how do the scattering amplitude and specific cross section behave for extremely small grazing angles? We consider the process of wave scattering by a statistically rough surface with the Neumann boundary condition. This model corresponds to sound scattering from a perfectly âhardâ surface (for example, the interface between air and the sea surface) or âverticallyâ polarized electromagnetic waves scattered by a perfectly conducting one-dimensional (i.e. cylindrical) surface when the magnetic field vector is directed along the generating line of this cylindrical surface. We assume that the surface roughness is sufficiently small (in the sense of the Rayleigh parameter) and the surface is rigorously statistically homogeneous and therefore, infinite. We confine ourselves only to the first-order approximation of small perturbation theory and therefore consider every act of wave scattering in the Born approximation when the Bragg scattering process takes place. Only one resonant Fourier component of surface roughness is responsible for the scattering in a given direction. However, we take into account the attenuation of incident and scattered waves due to the multiple scattering processes on the path âbeforeâ and âafterâ a scattering event in a given direction. Also we consider every one of these multiple scattering events only in the Born approximation. The main result we have obtained is that for small grazing angles the scattering cross section of the diffuse component decreases as the second power of the grazing angles with respect to the incident and scattered directions, and as the fourth power of the grazing angle for the backscattering (radar) situation. Generalizing our results from plane-wave scattering to finite beams allows us to obtain the criterion on the beamwidth. For sufficiently narrow beams the multiple scattering processes do not play any role because of a short âinteraction pathâ, and only single Bragg scattering determines the scattering amplitude (which does not tend to zero for small grazing angles). However, for sufficiently wide beams the result obtained for infinite plane waves becomes valid: due to the above-mentioned multiple scattering processes, the scattering amplitude tends to zero for small grazing angles. Consequently, the behaviour of the scattering cross section for small grazing angles depends on the radiation pattern width of the transmitting and receiving antennae: for sufficiently wide beams the scattering cross section decreases to zero at small grazing angles, but for narrow beams it tends to the finite non-zero value.},

  Abstract                 = {A bistatic electromagnetic wave scattering model for the sea surface is developed to examine its wind dependence property over a wide range of incident angles along the specular direction. This is done by combining an existing scattering model with a sea spectrum calibrated by altimeter measurements at 14 GHz. Generally, surface scattering is sensitive only to a portion of the surface correlation measured from the origin. The width of this portion is a function of three variables (the incident angle, the surface height standard deviation and the exploring wavelength) and the functional form of the correlation function. When the correlation function is very slowly decaying, this width may be significant even for surfaces with large surface standard deviations. It is worth noting that this latter property is characteristic of the sea surface and this is the reason why surface scattering model based on geometric optics is not generally applicable to sea surface scattering. For radar sensing of wind speed along the specular direction at L-band it appears that greater sensitivity occurs at larger incident angles. The HH scattering coefficient is much larger than VV as expected. For a wind speed range of 4 to 20 m/s the change in the scattering coefficient at 70 degrees is close to twice the change at normal incidence. Hence, the authors expect more accurate measurements of wind dependence at larger incident angles using horizontal polarization},

The method of small perturbation is used together with the Fourier transformation and results are carried up to and including the second-order. It is shown that first-order fields result from a single scattering process and second order fields result from a two-bounce multiple scattering process. It is also shown that regardless of the dielectric property of the surface, the incident wave number, the incident angle and the direction of the receiver combine to determine exactly the harmonic components of the surface that are responsible for scattering.},

  Abstract                 = {SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) is a European Space Agency mission that aims at generating global ocean salinity maps with an accuracy of 0.1 psu, at spatial and temporal resolution suitable for climatic studies. The satellite sensor is an L-band (1400-1427 MHz) aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer. Sea surface salinity (SSS) can be retrieved since the brightness temperature of sea water is dependent on the frequency, angle of observation, dielectric constant of sea water, sea surface temperature and sea surface state. This paper presents a new empirical sea water emissivity model at L-band in which surface roughness effects are parameterized in terms of wind speed and significant wave height. For the SMOS mission these parameters can be obtained from external measurements and model diagnostics. An analysis has been done on the effect on SSS retrieval of different sources for this auxiliary information.},

  Abstract                 = {The Local Oscillators (LO) of the Microwave Imaging Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) onboard the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite are used to maintain the operating frequency of the 69 receivers. The phase of the LO drifts over time, in turn blurring the MIRAS brightness temperature (TB) measurements. After a pre-launch assessment, it was decided to calibrate the LO every 10 minutes to reduce the phase drifts. During short periods of the first 2.5 years of SMOS mission, the LO calibration has been performed every 2 minutes to assess the impact of a higher calibration frequency on the quality of the data. In this study, relative differences (10-min TBs versus 2-min TBs) of about 0.3 K are shown, which lead to non-negligible relative differences of about 0.2-0.3 practical salinity units (psu) in the retrieved sea surface salinity (SSS). However, when performing independent validation against Argo float SSS data at Level 3 (spatio-temporally averaged SSS products), no significant differences are found between 10-min and 2-min data. This is due to the fact that current SMOS SSS accuracy (relative to Argo) is about 0.6-0.8 psu, thus masking the relatively smaller LO calibration frequency effect.},

  Abstract                 = {The In Situ Analysis System (ISAS) was developed to produce gridded fields of temperature and salinity that preserve as much as possible the time and space sampling capabilities of the Argo network of profiling floats. Since the first global re-analysis performed in 2009, the system has been extended to accommodate all types of vertical profile as well as time series. ISAS gridded fields are entirely based on in-situ measurements. The system aims at monitoring the time evolution of ocean properties for climatological studies and allowing easy computation of climate indices. A careful delayed mode processing of the 2002-2012 dataset has been carried out using version 6 of ISAS and updating the statistics to produce the ISAS-13 analysis. Note that ISAS-V6 is implemented as the operational analysis tool at the Coriolis data centre since June 2014.},

  Abstract                 = {Wind stress over the ocean depends on the sea surface roughness which is determined by the sea state. On one hand, underdeveloped wind seas, rougher than their fully developed counterpart, increase the drag. On the other hand, the presence of swell can modify wind stress by modifying the wind sea roughness. This latter mechanism is believed to have a great impact at high winds whenever underdeveloped local waves coexist with swell. Detailed measurements of wind stress and wavefield in fetch-limited growth conditions were made in an area subjected to strong and persistent winds. Through the analysis of wavefield observations, it is found that the presence of swell dampens the short wind waves. The observed attenuation is greater for younger wind seas and decreases as the wind waves become older. Results obtained from modeling the interaction of wind waves and the air flow above point out that the attenuation of short wind waves causes a reduction of the wave-supported stress, which in turn decreases the total wind stress.},

  abstract = {Based on our recently proposed horizontally isotropic internal wave spectrum (with its many uncertainties) we have developed a formalism for mixing due to internal wave shearing. Following an initial instability, the vertical shear is spread into a layer growing at just the rate required to maintain the layer Richardson number at a critical value. For instabilities in the gross density profile, the layer thickness is determined by the vertical scale of the shear maximum; fine-structure concentrates the instability along thin sheets and leads to more frequent breaking, but of smaller vertical extent (the scale now being determined by the fine-structure). The resultant buoyancy flux can be interpreted in terms of an eddy diffusivity, but the numerical evaluation is extremely uncertain. Properties of the internal wave field will cause the horizontal scale of the mixed layer so formed to exceed by several orders the vertical scale and similarly the horizontal diffusivity to exceed the vertical diffusivity. Both diffusivities decrease rapidly with increasing depth.},

  Abstract                 = {Partially polarimetric measurements of thermal emission from a striated water surface at 91.65 GHz illustrate the potential for remote sensing of water wave direction by passive microwave radiometry. The three Stokes parameter measurements were made using a precision polarimetric radiometer trained on a rotatable water wave tank at several elevation angles from near nadir to near grazing. The polarimetric measurements are well corroborated by calculations using a tilted-facet geometrical optics model for the water surface emission and scattering. Multiple scattering of the incident background radiation is incorporated for observation angles approaching grazing. The downwelling background brightness is computed by using an atmospheric radiative transfer model. We show that azimuthal brightness variations in the third Stokes parameter are in phase quadrature with the first and second modified Stokes parameters. For observation angles near Ë60Â°â70Â° from nadir the first three parameters have particularly large azimuthal brightness variations and thus have significant potential for measuring ocean wave direction. Moreover, the azimuthal brightness variations caused by water waves are not negligible for many passive microwave atmospheric sounding and surface remote sensing purposes, even at nadir. A range of elevation angles resulting in minimal azimuthal variations is identified.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of diurnal temperature variability at the ocean surface have been available primarily from satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) retrievals and a small number of ship-based radiometers. Since most areas are sampled from polar orbiting satellites at most twice a day, surface diurnal variability studies relied on theoretical modeling or extrapolation of results from in situ measurements at depth. The ocean surface responds very rapidly to changes in fluxes of heat and momentum, therefore diurnal variability at the ocean surface may be quite different than heating at depth. Measurements from the Marine Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (M-AERI) provide one of the few skin SST data sets augmented by ancillary measurements necessary for investigations into surface diurnal heating and cooling. This unique data set spans all major ocean basins and contains many days with diurnal warming. The timing of the peak in diurnal warming is directly related to the minimum wind speed and varies from 8:00 to 18:00 local-mean-time. Fluctuations in wind speed can result in multiple peaks in diurnal heating during a single afternoon. As wind speed increases, diurnal warming decreases (negatively correlated) and as insolation increases, diurnal warming increases (positively correlated). Changes in wind speed affect diurnal warming amplitudes very rapidly, while changes in insolation have a more gradual effect. The maximum correlation of wind speed (insolation) with changes in diurnal warming is at a time lag of 0 (50) min.},

The majority of the large events occurred in the extra-tropics. Given sufficient heating (from solar radiation), the location and magnitude of these events appears to be primarily determined by large-scale wind patterns. The amplitude of the measured diurnal heating scales inversely with the spatial resolution of the different sensors used in this study. These results indicate that predictions of peak diurnal warming using wind speeds with a 25 km spatial resolution available from satellite sensors and those with 50\&{\#}8211;100 km resolution from Numerical Weather Prediction models may have underestimated warming. Thus, the use of these winds in modeling diurnal effects will be limited in accuracy by both the temporal and spatial resolution of the wind fields.},

  abstract = {Shipboard radiometric measurements of diurnal warming at the ocean surface and profiles through the diurnal thermocline were utilized to assess the temporal and vertical variability and to develop a new physics-based model of near-surface warming. The measurements and modeled diurnal warming were compared, with the goal of comprehensively evaluating differences between the data and model results. On the basis of these results, the diurnal model was refined while attempting to maintain agreement with the measurements. Simplified bulk models commonly do not provide information on the vertical structure within the warm layer, but this new model predicts the vertical temperature profile within the diurnal thermocline using an empirically derived function dependent on wind speed. The vertical profile of temperature provides both a straightforward methodology for modeling differences due to diurnal warming between measurements made at different depths (e.g., in situ measurements at various depths and measurements of the surface temperatures by satellite radiometers) and information on upper ocean thermal structure. Additionally, the model estimates of diurnal warming at the ocean surface are important for air-sea heat and gas flux calculations, blending satellite sea surface temperature fields, and air-sea interaction studies.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a validation study of sea surface temperature (SST) retrievals from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). TMI SSTs are calculated using a radiative transfer-based retrieval algorithm, which precisely accounts for SST and wind effects on surface emissivity as well as atmospheric effects on brightness temperatures. TMI SSTs are compared to 4 years of the National Data Buoy Center, Tropical Atmosphere Ocean/Triangle Trans-Ocean Buoy Network (TAO/TRITON), and Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) moored buoy in situ SSTs. The microwave SSTs are shown to have a mean bias of â0.07$\,^{\circ}$C and a standard deviation of 0.57$\,^{\circ}$C when compared to the TAO/TRITON and PIRATA SSTs. A discussion of time series and dependencies of the accuracy of the TMI SSTs in the presence of varying wind, cloud, and water vapor for each of the buoy arrays is presented. TRMM's precessing equatorial orbit allows the diurnal variability to be determined, revealing midafternoon warming of the surface layer at wind speeds less than 6 m sâ1. Low-wind TAO/TRITON collocations show diurnal warming in both the TMI and buoy retrievals, with TMI's diurnal peak larger and 1 hour before the buoy peak. This decoupling of the skin-bulk SSTs results in larger standard deviations for daytime low-wind situations. This result has direct implications for future in situ validation studies, in situ-based regression algorithms, and future blended infrared/microwave/in situ SST products.},

Assessment of the salinity response was aided by additional satellite observations, including chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and ocean surface currents, and a passive tracer simulation. Low SSS values associated with the spreading of the river plume were observed 1-3 \80\89months after peak river discharge which then receded and became unidentifiable from satellite observations 5âmonths after maximum discharge. The seasonal wind pattern and general circulation of the GoM dramatically impacted the observed salinity response, transporting freshwater eastward along the Gulf coast and entraining low salinity waters into the open GoM. The observed salinity response from Aquarius was consistent with SMOS SSS, chl-a concentrations, and the passive tracer simulation in terms of the pathway and transit time of the river plume spreading. This study is the first successful application of satellite SSS to study salinity variation in marginal seas.},

Temperature or salinity changes are calculated in a volume of water above an isopycnal that is below the mixed layer and not subject to mixed-layer entrainment. Horizontal advection components from geostrophic velocity and from Ekman transport, based on wind stress, are also included. The climatological monthly heat or freshwater flux at the ocean surface is estimated as the sum of advective and time tendency contributions. The air-sea flux estimates from Argo are described in global maps and basin-wide integrals, in comparison to atmospheric reanalysis data and to air-sea flux products based on observations. This ocean-based estimate of surface fluxes is consistent with property variations in the subsurface ocean and indicates greater amplitude for the climatological monthly heat flux values in the subtropics compared to other products. Similarly, the combination of Argo freshwater flux and reanalysis evaporation, suggests greater amplitude for climatological monthly precipitation in the tropics.},

  Abstract                 = {Theoretical understanding of the dependence of sea state bias (SSB) on wind wave conditions has been achieved only for the case of a unidirectional wind-driven sea [Jackson, 1979; Rodriguez et al., 1992; Glazman and Srokosz, 1991]. Recent analysis of Geosat and TOPEX altimeter data showed that additional factors, such as swell, ocean currents, and complex directional properties of realistic wave fields, may influence SSB behavior. Here we investigate effects of two-dimensional multimodal wave spectra using a numerical model of radar reflection from a random, non-Gaussian surface. A recently proposed ocean wave spectrum is employed to describe sea surface statistics. The following findings appear to be of particular interest: (1) Sea swell has an appreciable effect in reducing the SSB coefficient compared with the pure wind sea case but has less effect on the actual SSB, owing to the corresponding increase in significant wave height. (2) Hidden multimodal structure (the two-dimensional wavenumber spectrum contains separate peaks, for swell and wind seas, while the frequency spectrum looks unimodal) results in an appreciable change of SSB. (3) For unimodal, purely wind-driven seas, the influence of the angular spectral width is relatively unimportant; that is, a unidirectional sea provides a good qualitative model for SSB if the swell is absent. (4) The pseudo wave age is generally much better for parametrizing the SSB coefficient than the actual wave age (which is ill-defined for a multimodal sea) or wind speed. (5) SSB can be as high as 5% of the significant wave height, which is significantly greater than predicted by present empirical model functions tuned on global data sets. (6) Parameterization of SSB in terms of wind speed is likely to lead to errors due to the dependence on the (in practice, unknown) fetch.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a method and experimental results for near-surface wind sensing using reflected Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals received on a spacecraft. The estimation method proposed involves four steps. First, the bistatic radar cross section (BRCS) of the received signal is estimated from the measurements. Second, the BRCS measurements are calibrated to agree with existing theoretical and empirical wind #x02013;wave models. Next, a geometric optics-based scattering model is used to estimate the sea surface slopes, based on the reflection geometry and the measured BRCS. Finally, the surface winds are estimated using an empirically derived function relating the surface mean square slopes to near-surface wind speed. The accuracy of the proposed inversion technique is then tested using a set of 25 space-based GNSS reflection measurements over a range of wind speeds. These measurements were all taken in the proximity of ocean buoys which provided in situ ocean wind speed information. The wind estimates from the buoys were then compared with the wind retrievals made from the measurements and found to be accurate to a root-mean-square error of 1.84 m/s. Additionally, the potential error sources in the measurements are analyzed, including a simulation of the effects of wind direction on the BRCS measurements. This first demonstration of space-based GNSS scatterometry using a small set of sample measurements will hopefully provide a benchmark and example for future experiments.},

We will present waveforms of ocean-reflected GPS signals that have been detected using the experiment onboard the United Kingdom's Disaster Monitoring Constellation satellite and describe the processing methods used to obtain their delay and Doppler power distributions. The GPS bistatic radar experiment has made several raw data collections, and reflected GPS signals have been found on all attempts. The down linked data from an experiment has undergone extensive processing, and ocean-scattered signals have been mapped across a wide range of delay and Doppler space revealing characteristics which are known to be related to geophysical parameters such as surface roughness and wind speed. Here we will discuss the effects of integration time, reflection incidence angle and examine several delay-Doppler signal maps. The signals detected have been found to be in general agreement with an existing model (based on geometric optics) and with limited independent measurements of sea winds; a brief comparison is presented here. These results demonstrate that the concept of using bistatically reflected global navigation satellite systems signals from low earth orbit is a viable means of ocean remote sensing.},

  abstract = {A large body of information from a number of sources is brought together and an error budget is deduced giving the projected overall height uncertainty correction for a suggested next generation high-precision radar altimeter. Uncertainties introduced by the wet and dry troposphere, clouds, and the ionosphere are reviewed. A suggested next-generation precision altimeter is assumed to be dual frequency (13.5 and 6 GHz) designed to correct out the ionospheric error. The altimeter-carrying satellite will include a nadir pointing near coincidentbeam dual-frequency microwave radiometer for mitigating the wet tropospheric uncertainty. Although there are a number of caveats, the combined uncertainty in the height correction due to the atmosphere for the suggested system should be nominally 3 cm rms compared to at least 6 cm associated with the Seasat-A mission. Improvements in height resolution of the kind referred to here are vital for future satellite missions designed to monitor ocean currents (e.g., TOPEX).},

  abstract = {SeaWiFS high-resolution ocean-color images and AVHRR sea-surface temperature were obtained for the period from November 1998 to March 1999. Generation of mesoscale eddies was observed for the region between the Gulf of Tehuantepec and the Gulf of Papagayo (Tropical Pacific Ocean). Eighteen eddies with diameters ranging between 100 and 450 km were identified; 14 originated in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and most were cyclonic. Our results show that the frequency of cyclonic eddy formation is higher than it has been reported and their lifetime can be longer. Using both ocean color images and daily temporal resolution, instead of sea-surface temperature alone, improved our ability to identify and follow the propagation of these eddies. The generation and fate of smaller cyclonic eddies around the periphery of the anticyclonic eddy indicate the importance of the onshore-offshore exchange of energy and biological material, which has not been considered previously. Three anticyclonic eddies were generated in the Gulf of Papagayo. These eddies have a common origin, and they travel along the main flux of the Costa Rica Coastal Current (CRCC), which later turns offshore and joins the North Equatorial Current. This behavior can be seen clearly on SeaWiFS images and suggests that the CRCC influences eddy propagation. Time series of chlorophyll-a concentration and SST were obtained from two points at Tehuantepec and two at Papagayo. Cross-correlation analysis confirms an inverse relationship between these variables, showing that a decrease in SST is followed by an increase in chlorophyll-a concentration values, indicating high growth and primary production rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) represents a transfer of upper layer water to abyssal depths at a rate of 15 to 20 Ã 106 m3/s. NADW spreads throughout the Atlantic Ocean and is exported to the Indian and Pacific Oceans by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and deep western boundary currents. Naturally, there must be a compensating flow of upper layer water toward the northern North Atlantic to feed NADW production. It is proposed that this return flow is accomplished primarily within the ocean's warm water thermocline layer. In this way the main thermoclines of the ocean are linked as they participate in a thermohaline-driven global scale circulation cell associated with NADW formation. The path of the return flow of warm water is as follows: Pacific to Indian flow within the Indonesian Seas, advection across the Indian Ocean in the 10Â°â15Â°S latitude belt, southward transfer in the Mozambique Channel, entry into the South Atlantic by a branch of the Agulhas Current that does not complete the retroflection pattern, northward advection within the subtropical gyre of the South Atlantic (which on balance with the southward flux of colder North Atlantic Deep Water supports the northward oceanic heat flux characteristic of the South Atlantic), and cross-equatorial flow into the western North Atlantic. The magnitude of the return flow increases along its path as more NADW is incorporated into the upper layer of the ocean. Additionally, the water mass characteristics of the return flow are gradually altered by regional ocean-atmosphere interaction and mixing processes. Within the Indonesian seas there is evidence of strong vertical mixing across the thermocline. The cold water route, Pacific to Atlantic transport of Subantarctic water within the Drake Passage, is of secondary importance, amounting to perhaps 25% of the warm water route transport. The continuity or vigor of the warm water route is vulnerable to change not only as the thermohaline forcing in the northern North Atlantic varies but also as the larger-scale wind-driven circulation factors vary. The interocean links within the Indonesian seas and at the Agulhas retroflection may be particularly responsive to such variability. Changes in the warm water route continuity may in turn influence formation characteristics of NADW.},

  Abstract                 = {After 2.5 years of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, the characterization of residual instrumental systematic errors in the measured brightness temperatures (TB) is still rather poor. This, in turn, negatively impacts the sea surface salinity retrievals and, as such, notably limits the mission's success. The error mitigation methodology currently used operationally, the so-called Ocean Target Transformation (OTT), mixes both instrumental and model-induced errors. In this paper, it is proposed to distinguish errors by their type of impact on the TB images: mean brightness level, incidence angle dependence, and azimuth angle dependence. A new approach to characterize the azimuth-dependent errors is proposed. First, a careful data selection strategy is applied. Then, an empirically fitted model, which only accounts for the TB incidence angle dependence, is subtracted from the mean TB images of the selected data sets to estimate the systematic antenna-frame errors. The robustness of this methodology is assessed through the estimated anomaly pattern stability when computed for different geophysical conditions, periods of time, and latitudinal bands. The residual variability ranges from 0.03 K to 0.14 K, whereas the OTT variability is about 0.5 K. The new method is forward model independent and generic. It can therefore be applied to estimate the antenna-frame systematic errors over land and ice. Moreover, it proves to be very effective in separating different sources of error and can therefore be used to further characterize other error components and improve the various SMOS forward model terms.},

  abstract = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission was launched on November 2nd, 2009 aiming at providing sea surface salinity (SSS) estimates over the oceans with frequent temporal coverage. The detection and mitigation of residual instrumental systematic errors in the measured brightness temperatures are key steps prior to the SSS retrieval. For such purpose, the so-called ocean target transformation (OTT) technique is currently used in the SMOS operational SSS processor. In this paper, an assessment of the OTT is performed. It is found that, to compute a consistent and robust OTT, a large ensemble of measurements is required. Moreover, several effects are reported to significantly impact the OTT computation, namely, the apparent instrument (temporal) drift, forward model imperfections, auxiliary data (used by forward model) uncertainty and external error sources, such as galactic noise and Sun effects (among others). These effects have to be properly mitigated or filtered during the OTT computation, so as to successfully retrieve SSS from SMOS measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {The transfer of heat and momentum by motion on the scale of cyclone waves and long waves is deduced from a knowledge of their mechanics. The law of horizontal transfer of entropy is independent of notions of mixing but is similar to that for non-isotropic diffusion. The law accurately represents the annual variation of heat-flux in the Northern Hemisphere. Perturbation theory suggests realistic spatial variations for the transfer and provides a rational basis for calculating transfer coefficients which can then be used to find the flux of other conservative quantities. Most importantly the Equatorward flux of potential vorticity is well defined and is shown to determine the horizontal flux of momentum uv. The mean surface winds, and the mean meridional circulation (which is seen to be frictionally driven) are then determined. A model of the general circulation is defined by these properties, and this is integrated analytically for a simplified case and compared with motion observed in the Gulf Stream, the mesosphere, and dishpan experiments as well as the troposphere.},

  Abstract                 = {Scatterometer radar backscatter depends on the relationship linking surface stress and surface roughness. SST can alter the growth rate of centimeter-scale waves through its impact on air and water density and water viscosity. This SST-dependency hasnotbeen included in the standard Geophysical Model Functions. This study uses a radar imaging model to evaluate this SST-dependence and compares the results to observations from QuikScat Ku-band and ASCAT C-band scatterometers. A SST correction could raise wind speeds by up to 0.2 msâ1in the storm track region of the Southern Ocean for C-band scatterometers. For the higher frequency Ku-band scatterometers, a SST-induced reduction up to 0.4 msâ1 is predicted south of 60Â°S, where SST is cold and winds are moderate.},

The SSS pattern during different stages of the MJO propagation across the Indian Ocean are analyzed conditioned on season and phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation. The processes through which the SSS patterns develop depend upon anomalous atmospheric conditions and oceanic processes during the different stages of the MJO. The combinations of anomalous conditions during each stage of the MJO with seasonal and long-term climate variations create different responses in SSS. The SSS variability during the MJO may produce numerous indirect feedbacks, which are the result of SSS altering the depth of the Barrier Layer (BL) and mixed layer. Satellite salinity measurements will enhance our knowledge of the SSS variability during different stages of the MJO propagation.},

  abstract = {An ocean reanalysis that covers the period from 1871 to 2008 is used to analyze the interannual variability of sea surface salinity (SSS) in the tropical Indian Ocean. The reanalysis SSS and the SSS anomaly patterns during Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are compared with patterns from Argo SSS data. The mean seasonal SSS variation is large in the northern Bay of Bengal compared with variations in the Arabian Sea and equatorial Indian Ocean. During a positive IOD event, positive SSS anomalies are found along the Sumatra coast that are due to the combination of wind-driven upwelling of subsurface high-salinity waters, enhanced evaporation, and anomalous surface circulation. The opposite is true, to a lesser extent, during negative IOD events. A dipole mode index for salinity (DMIS) based on SSS data and a new index based on the average of salinity in a region off the coast of Sumatra are introduced to monitor SSS variability during IOD and ENSO events. The impact of concomitant El NiÃ±o events on a positive IOD event is large with freshening (a negative SSS anomaly) in the equatorial Indian Ocean and salting (positive SSS anomaly) off the southern Sumatra coast. The (impact of) intense freshening reaches into the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean. The impact of concomitant La NiÃ±a with negative IOD is also large with an intense freshening in the southeastern Arabian Sea and salting off the northern Sumatra coast.},

  abstract = {Satellite derived sea surface salinity (SSS) data from Aquarius and SMOS are used to study the shelf-open ocean exchanges in the western South Atlantic near 35ÂºS. Away from the tropics these exchanges cause the largest SSS variability throughout the South Atlantic. The data reveal a well defined seasonal pattern of SSS during the analyzed period and of the location of the export of low salinity shelf waters. In spring and summer low salinity waters over the shelf expand offshore and are transferred to the open ocean primarily southeast of the river mouth (from 36 ÂºS to 37Âº30âS). In contrast, in fall and winter low salinity waters extend along a coastal plume and the export path to the open ocean distributes along the offshore edge of the plume. The strong seasonal SSS pattern is modulated by the seasonality of the along-shelf component of the wind stress over the shelf. However, the combined analysis of SSS, satellite-derived sea surface elevation and surface velocity data suggest that the precise location of the export of shelf waters depends on offshore circulation patterns, such as the location of the Brazil Malvinas Confluence and mesoscale eddies and meanders of the Brazil Current. The satellite data indicate that in summer, mixtures of low salinity shelf waters are swiftly driven towards the ocean interior along the axis of the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence. In winter, episodic wind reversals force the low salinity coastal plume offshore where they mix with tropical waters within the Brazil Current and create a warmer variety of low salinity waters in the open ocean.},

  Abstract                 = {As part of a measuring program dedicated to the analysis of the dielectric properties of seawater in the frequency range 3-89 GHz, a new dielectric permittivity model based on the standard Debye theory has been developed for remote sensing applications over the ocean below 40 GHz, together with polynomial interpolations at the millimeter frequencies 85.5 and 89 GHz. The aim of this paper is to test the relevance of these new dielectric measurements through statistical comparisons of radiative transfer predictions with satellite and airborne radiometric data between 18 and 89 GHz. A radiometric sensitivity analysis to the permittivity measurement errors is proposed, which yields a sea surface brightness temperature accuracy of at least 0.5 K below 20 GHz, 1 K at 24 GHz, and 1.5 K at 37 and 89 GHz. At frequencies less than 40 GHz, superiority of the revised Debye model is pointed out over the most commonly used model of Klein and Swift [1977]. At millimeter frequencies the new permittivity expressions deviate significantly from the standard Debye predictions, especially at low temperature, suggesting the influence of a second "high-frequency" Debye relaxation. Our comparisons with radiometric data at 89 GHz and in the channel 85.5V of the special sensor microwave imager tend to support this hypothesis. The results emphasize the importance of an adequate modeling of the complex permittivity of seawater as input to the surface emissivity models, at any frequency of the microwave spectrum, and augur interesting outputs in both in-flight calibration and interpretation of satellite data.},

  abstract       = {The Pilot-Mission Exploitation Platform (Pi-MEP) for salinity is an ESA initiative originally meant to support and widen the uptake of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission data over the ocean. Starting in 2017, the project aims at setting up a computational web-based platform focusing on satellite sea surface salinity data, supporting studies on enhanced validation and scientific process over the ocean. It has been designed in close collaboration with a dedicated science advisory group in order to achieve three main objectives: gathering all the data required to exploit satellite sea surface salinity data, systematically producing a wide range of metrics for comparing and monitoring sea surface salinity products? quality, and providing user-friendly tools to explore, visualize and exploit both the collected products and the results of the automated analyses. The Salinity Pi-MEP is becoming a reference hub for the validation of satellite sea surface salinity missions by providing valuable information on satellite products (SMOS, Aquarius, SMAP), an extensive in situ database (e.g., Argo, thermosalinographs, moorings, drifters) and additional thematic datasets (precipitation, evaporation, currents, sea level anomalies, sea surface temperature, etc.). Co-localized databases between satellite products and in situ datasets are systematically generated together with validation analysis reports for 30 predefined regions. The data and reports are made fully accessible through the web interface of the platform. The datasets, validation metrics and tools (automatic, user-driven) of the platform are described in detail in this paper. Several dedicated scienctific case studies involving satellite SSS data are also systematically monitored by the platform, including major river plumes, mesoscale signatures in boundary currents, high latitudes, semi-enclosed seas, and the high-precipitation region of the eastern tropical Pacific. Since 2019, a partnership in the Salinity Pi-MEP project has been agreed between ESA and NASA to enlarge focus to encompass the entire set of satellite salinity sensors. The two agencies are now working together to widen the platform features on several technical aspects, such as triple-collocation software implementation, additional match-up collocation criteria and sustained exploitation of data from the SPURS campaigns.},

  Abstract                 = {Differences and complementarities between altimeter and hydrographic data are studied to describe the sea level and ocean circulation variations in terms of steric and non-steric contributions. Altimeter sea level anomalies (SLA) and hydrographic dynamic height anomalies (DHA) agree remarkably well. They also reveal, however, systematic large-scale differences in several areas of the Pacific and Indian oceans that are related to a barotropic, Sverdrup-like, response of the ocean to wind forcing. In addition, the use of the two data sets provides a good estimation of the partition between barotropic and baroclinic modes needed for data synthesis or assimilation studies.},

Successively discussed are the limitations of the linear surface waves theory, the assumptions implied by and the inadequacies of the method used to obtain the spatial spectrum of the sea surface from the temporal spectrum, and the poor knowledge of the spectrum angular, behavior. It is stressed that the sea surface is not uniquely determined by the wind speed and that it should be depicted by a more complete set of internal parameters. Relationships between some usual sea state parameters, such as H1/3, Ï, u*a, and U(z) are discussed. On the other hand the available methods for solving the electromagnetic scattering problem are briefly discussed, and it is shown that the assumptions implied by Brown's (1978) two-scale model, based on the boundary perturbation method, are roughly satisfied when applied to the sea surface. The contribution that particular scattering mechanisms could provide to the scattered power is estimated. The azimuthal behavior of the backscattering coefficient is taken as an illustration.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the variability of sea surface salinity (SSS) in the western equatorial Pacific fresh pool. For this purpose, we processed data collected from thermosalinographs embarked on merchant ships. Two main cross-equatorial shipping lines that are representative of the oceanic conditions in the western tropical Pacific were selected: the Japan-Tarawa-Fiji line that crosses the equator near 173Â°E (eastern track) and the New-Caledonia-Japan line that crosses the equator near 156Â°E (western track). We show that there is a strong SSS variability in the region at monthly as well as interannual timescales. This high variability is attributed to the successive passages of a zonal salinity front, trapped in the (5Â°Nâ5Â°S) equatorial band and migrating in phase with the southern oscillation index. We also found the eastern track to be more variable in SSS because it is more exposed to these SSS front incursions. We carried out a detailed study of the mechanisms responsible for this variability; it revealed that the rainfall input acts as a source of freshwater responsible for the existence of a contrasted distribution of SSS (mainly high-salinity waters in the central Pacific and low-salinity waters in the western Pacific). However, the main mechanism responsible for the SSS variability is zonal advection that makes the two distinct masses of water converge, resulting in a salinity front which shifts back and forth in the equatorial band.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we assess the impact of sea surface salinity (SSS) observations on seasonal variability of tropical dynamics as well as on dynamical El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts using a hybrid coupled model (HCM). The HCM is composed of a primitive equation ocean model coupled with a singular value decomposition-based statistical atmospheric model. An Ensemble Reduced Order Kalman Filter (EROKF) is used to assimilate observations to constrain tropical Pacific dynamics and thermodynamics for initialization of the HCM. Rather than trying to produce the best possible operational forecasts, point-wise subsurface temperature (sTz) has been assimilated separately and together with gridded observed sea surface salinity (SSS) from optimal interpolation to more efficiently isolate the impact of SSS. Coupled experiments are then initiated from these EROKF initial conditions and run for 12 months for each month, 1993-2007. The results show that adding SSS to sTz assimilation improves coupled forecasts for 6-12 month lead times. The main benefit of SSS assimilation comes from improvement to the spring predictability barrier (SPB) period. SSS assimilation increases correlation for 6-12 month forecasts by 0.2-0.5 and reduces RMS error by 0.3Â°C-0.6Â°C for forecasts initiated between December and March, a period key to long-lead ENSO forecasts. The positive impact of SSS assimilation originates from warm pool and Southern Hemisphere salinity anomalies. Improvements are brought about by fresh anomalies at the equator which increases stability, reduces mixing, and shoals the thermocline which concentrates the wind impact of ENSO coupling. This effect is most pronounced in June-August, helping to explain the improvement in the SPB. In addition, we show that SSS impact on coupled forecasts is more pronounced for the period 1993-2001 than for the period 2002-2007 due to the improved inherent predictability associated with the strong 1997-1998 ENSO. Rather than being the final say for the issue of SSS assimilation, this study should be considered as a necessary first step. Future work is still required to assess issues such as SSS satellite data coverage and the complementary nature of satellite/in situ assimilation. However, these results foreshadow the important positive potential impact that gridded satellite SSS provided by missions such as SMOS and Aquarius/SAC-D will have on coupled model predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, we present results which are designed to isolate the role of the ocean initial condition prior to the 2006 El Ni\~no. Analysis of the differences between model experiments with the same forcing but different initial conditions shows several key dynamical elements of the 2006 El Ni\~no that were evident in the initial state of the ocean. Between November 2005 and March 2006, the eastern Pacific was cold due to an upwelling Kelvin wave. By May 2006, the combined impact of downwelling Kelvin and upwelling Rossby waves had carried warm SST eastward over the entire equatorial Pacific. From May until September, westward advection of cold waters by a downwelling Rossby wave temporarily reduced temperatures in the tropical Pacific. The El Ni\~no was fully manifest when the second downwelling Kelvin wave traversed the Pacific in October to December 2006. A statistical atmospheric model forced by the sea surface temperature anomalies from these experiments isolates the atmospheric response to oceanic initial condition and can help guide coupled model forecasts. East of the dateline, easterlies limit the early growth of this event prior to May 2006 through destructive interference of any downwelling signal. During May 2006, warm SST is associated with westerly wind anomalies which stretch across the entire basin. However, cold advection from an upwelling Rossby wave limits the duration of these westerlies. After July, westerlies prevail over the central Pacific as the 2006 El Ni\~no develops into a fully coupled event. Although high quality global ocean observations allow ever improving estimates of the initial ocean state for coupled ocean-atmosphere prediction models, the amplitude of 2006 El Ni\~no was under-predicted prior to September 2006 as measured by composite forecast indices. Our methodology of isolating the role of the initial state of the ocean reproduces all the major features of the 2006 event and has merit for use in conjunction with coupled-model forecasts to improve long-range predictions of El Ni\~no.},

  Abstract                 = {This report presents a theoretical discussion of the statistical properties of radio waves reflected from the moon. The discussion is based on the assumption of a large number of scattering areas simultaneously contributing to the signal. The properties of the echoes are usually described in terms of pulse broadening or by means of an average-power pulse response when very short pulses are transmitted. Here it is shown that the same type of information can be obtained by studying the correlation of complex amplitudes of two sine waves reflected from the moon at frequencies separated by ÎÏ. By studying this correlation as a function of ÎÏ it is possible to compute the power pulse response of the earth-moon-earth propagation circuit. It is suggested that this method will prove particularly useful in the study of the surface properties of more distant targets such as the planets. It is also shown how the correlation technique can be extended to a two-dimensional mapping of a rotating rough body. The properties of the echoes returned from the moon are related here to a crude statistical model of the lunar surface roughness. This model is shown to lead to a satisfactory account for the semispecular component of the return from the moon if a large-scale structure with rms slopes of 1/20 to 1/10 are assumed.},

We also call attention to a number of common errors in the application of windows when used with the fast Fourier transform. This paper includes a comprehensive catalog of data windows along with their significant performance parameters from which the different windows can be compared. Finally, an example demonstrates the use and value of windows to resolve closely spaced harmonic signals characterized by large differences in amplitude.},

  Abstract                 = {A new, closed nonlinear integral transformation relation is derived describing the mapping of a two-dimensional ocean wave spectrum into a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image spectrum. The general integral relation is expanded in a power series with respect to orders of nonlinearity and velocity bunching. The individual terms of the series can be readily computed using fast Fourier transforms. The convergence of the series is rapid. The series expansion is also useful in identifying the different contributions to the net imaging process, consisting of the real aperture radar (RAR) cross-section modulation, the nonlinear motion (velocity bunching) effects, and their various interaction products. The lowest term of the expansion with respect to nonlinearity order yields a simple quasi-linear approximate mapping relation consisting of the standard linear SAR modulation expression multiplied by an additional nonlinear Gaussian azimuthal cutoff factor. The cutoff scale is given by the rms azimuthal (velocity bunching) displacement. The same cutoff factor applies to all terms of the power series expansion. The nonlinear mapping relation is inverted using a standard first-guess wave spectrum as regularization term. This is needed to overcome the basic 180Â° mapping ambiguity and the loss of information beyond the azimuthal cutoff. The inversion is solved numerically using an iteration technique based on the successive application of the explicit solution for the quasi-linear mapping approximation, with interposed corrections invoking the full nonlinear mapping expression. A straightforward application of this technique, however, generally yields unrealistic discontinuities of the best fit wave spectrum in the transition region separating the low azimuthal wave number domain, in which useful SAR information is available and the wave spectrum is modified, from the high azimuthal wave number region beyond the azimuthal cutoff, where the first-guess wave spectrum is retained. This difficulty is overcome by applying a two-step inversion procedure. In the first step the energy level of the wave spectrum is adjusted, and the wave number plane rotated and rescaled, without altering the shape of the spectrum. Using the resulting globally fitted spectrum as the new first-guess input spectrum, the original inversion method is then applied without further constraints in a second step to obtain a final fine-scale optimized spectrum. The forward mapping relation and inversion algorithms are illustrated for three Seasat cases representing different wave conditions corresponding to weakly, moderately, and strongly nonlinear imaging conditions.},

A common focus for different scattering models is provided by the mean image impulse response function, which is shown to be identical to the (spatially varying) frequency variance spectrum of the local complex reflectivity coefficient. From the analysis has emerged a more complete view of the SAR imaging phenomenon than has been previously available. A new, generalized imaging model is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {An earlier algorithm for retrieving two-dimensional wave spectra from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image spectra is improved by using a modified cost function and introducing an additional iteration loop in which the first-guess input spectrum is systematically updated. For this purpose a spectral partitioning scheme is applied in which the spectrum is decomposed into a finite number of distinct wave systems. At each iteration step, the individual wave systems of the partitioned nth-guess wave spectrum are adjusted to agree in mean energy, frequency, and direction with the corresponding mean values of the associated wave systems of the SAR-inverted wave spectrum. The algorithm retrieves smooth wave spectra, avoiding the discontinuities which tended to arise in the previous algorithm in the transition region near the azimuthal wavenumber cutoff of the SAR image spectrum. The azimuthal cutoff of the SAR spectrum is also reproduced more accurately. The greatest improvement of the new retrieval algorithm is obtained when the discrepancies between the initial first-guess wave spectrum and the observed SAR spectrum are large. In this case the additional updating loop for the input spectrum enables the retrieved spectrum to adjust such that the simulated SAR spectrum matches more closely the observed SAR spectrum. The overall correlation of a large set of simulated SAR spectra with the measured SAR spectra is found to be significantly higher than with the previous algorithm, indicating that the algorithm not only overcomes isolated shortcomings of the earlier algorithm but also yields retrieved wave spectra which are generally more consistent with the input SAR data. An additional practical advantage of the new algorithm is that it returns spectral partioning parameters which can be used in SAR wave data assimilation schemes.},

We use two monthly gridded products of SSS based on in situ measurements, high-resolution along-track Voluntary Observing Ships thermo-salinograph data, new SMOS satellite data, and a validated ocean general circulation model with no direct SSS relaxation. All products reveal a seasonal cycle of the location of the 36-isohaline barycenter of about Â±400 km in longitude in response to changes in the South Pacific Convergence Zone location and Easterly winds intensity. They also show a low frequency westward shift of the barycenter of 1400 km from the mid 1990s to the early 2010s that could not be linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomena. In the model, the processes maintaining the 22 year equilibrium of the high salinity in the mixed layer are the surface forcing (â¼+0.73 pss/yr), the horizontal salinity advection (â¼â0.37 pss/yr), and processes occurring at the mixed layer base (â¼â0.35 pss/yr).},

  abstract = {The tropical Pacific Ocean remained in a La NiÃ±a phase from mid-2010 to mid-2012. In this study, the 2010\E2\80-2011 near-surface salinity signature of ENSO (El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation) is described and analyzed using a combination of numerical model output, in situ data, and SMOS satellite salinity products. Comparisons of all salinity products show a good agreement between them, with a RMS error of 0.2-0.3 between the thermosalinograph (TSG) and SMOS data and between the TSG and model data. The last 6 months of 2010 are characterized by an unusually strong tripolar anomaly captured by the three salinity products in the western half of the tropical Pacific. A positive SSS anomaly sits north of 10\B0S (>0.5), a negative tilted anomaly lies between 10Â°S and 20Â°S and a positive one south of 20Â°S. In 2011, anomalies shift south and amplify up to 0.8, except for the one south of 20\B0S. Equatorial SSS changes are mainly the result of anomalous zonal advection, resulting in negative anomalies during El NiÃ±o (early 2010), and positive ones thereafter during La NiÃ±a. The mean seasonal and interannual poleward drift exports those anomalies toward the south in the southern hemisphere, resulting in the aforementioned tripolar anomaly. The vertical salinity flux at the bottom of the mixed layer tends to resist the surface salinity changes. The observed basin-scale La NiÃ±a SSS signal is then compared with the historical 1998-1999 La NiÃ±a event using both observations and modeling.},

  abstract = {Abstract Strong variability in sea surface salinity (SSS) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETPac) on intraseasonal to interannual timescales was studied using data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, Soil Moisture Active Passive, and Aquarius satellite missions. A zonal wave number-frequency spectral analysis of SSS reveals a dominant timescale of 50-180 days and spatial scale of 8\B0-20\B0 of longitude with a distinct seasonal cycle and interannual variability. This intraseasonal SSS signal is detailed in the study of 19 individual ETPac eddies over 2010-2016 identified by their sea level anomalies, propagating westward at a speed of about 17 cm/s. ETPac eddies trap and advect water in their core westward up to 40Â° of longitude away from the coast. The SSS signatures of these eddies, with an average anomaly of 0.5-pss magnitude difference from ambient values, enable the study of their dynamics and the mixing of their core waters with the surroundings. Three categories of eddies were identified according to the location where they were first tracked: (1) in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, (2) in the Gulf of Papagayo, and (3) in the open ocean near 100\B0W-12\B0N. They all traveled westward near 10\B0N latitude. Category 3 is of particular interest, as eddies seeded in the Gulf of Tehuantepec grew substantially in the vicinity of the Clipperton Fracture Zone rise and in a region where the mean zonal currents have anticyclonic shear. The evolution of the SSS signature associated with the eddies indicates the importance of mixing to their dissipation.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the application of phased-array high-frequency (HF) radars to identify locations of enhanced local waveheights. Measurements of the near-surface current velocities and waveheights were obtained from HF radars deployed near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay in the fall of 1997. The radar-derived near-surface velocities were compared with the upper bin (2-m depth) of four upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). The slopes of the linear correlations were close to one and the root-mean-square (rms) differences were similar to previous studies. Significant waveheight (Hs) estimates from both radars were compared with a laser height gauge. The largest differences were observed during low winds due to overestimates at one of the radar stations and during storms when the laser measurement failed. Further analysis focused on the HF radar results from the more reliable of the two sites. The rms difference between this radar and the in situ sensor was 0.29 m. Synoptic observations of Hs over the Chesapeake Bay revealed regions of current-induced wave shoaling and refraction. Hs over the estuarine outflow increased between 19-50% relative to the incident Hs in light onshore winds (~5 m/s). In stronger winds ( gt;10 m/s), Hs also increased by up to 25% when there was a tidal outflow in the surface layer, although the near-surface currents were responding to both the wind and the ebbing tide. Hs was not enhanced when the outflow was below a thicker layer ( gt;5 m) of wind-forced onshore flow},

  Abstract                 = {Ocean wave spectra were retrieved from a set of ERS-I synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wave mode (SWM) spectra between January 1993 and December 1995. An assessment is given of the SWM data quality and the retrieval performance as well as the operational feasibility of the retrieval algorithm. Sensitivity studies are performed to demonstrate the weak residual dependence of the retrieval on the first-guess input spectrum. The mean spectral parameters of the SWM retrievals are compared with spectral parameters from collocated wave model (WAM) spectra. The time series of SWM-retrieved and WAM-derived monthly mean significant wave heights Hs in various ocean basins show good overall agreement but with a small systematic underestimation of Hs by the WAM. A decomposition of the wave spectra into wind sea and swell reveals an average 10% overprediction of the wind sea by the WAM while swell is underpredicted by 20â30%. The positive wind-sea bias exhibits no clear wave height dependence, while the negative swell bias decreases with swell wave height. This could be due to a too strong damping in the WAM at low frequencies. Detailed regional investigations point to the existence of smaller-scale phenomena, which may not be adequately reproduced by the WAM at the present resolution of the wind forcing. Finally, an intercomparison is made of the observed and modeled azimuthal cutoff length scales, and global distributions are investigated. Ratios of the observed azimuthal cutoff wavenumber to the mean azimuthal wavenumber component indicate that about 75% of the swell can be directly resolved by the SAR, while about 70% of the wind sea lies at least partially beyond the cutoff.},

This paper compares and contrasts the data analysis required at different electromagnetic wavelengths. At large wavenumbers the observed spreading depends not only on the directional spreading at the Bragg wavenumber, but also on the weighted integrals over all shorter wavenumbers. This is discussed in terms of microwave and VHF Doppler spectra. At small wavenumbers (HF) the observed directional spreading should be directly predicted by the model. It is in this simple case that there is an inconsistency between the models and the observations, and this has a potential impact on the use of the models at all wavenumbers.},

  Abstract                 = {The MTF (modulation transfer function) is the primary descriptor used to relate the variations of the electromagnetic backscatter from the ocean to the ocean wave parameters. The major assumption involved in the definition of the MTF is a linear relation between the backscattered power and the long-wave slope. An investigation of this assumption is presented showing that the backscattered power and wave-height are nonlinearly related at least for tilt modulation. The nonlinear relation between the backscattered power and the long-wave slope is analyzed for both vertically and horizontally polarized backscatterers. For HH polarization, at maximum slopes of 0.1 rad, the second harmonic contribution is 37% for a pointing angle of 20Â° and reaches its minimum of roughly 19% at a pointing angle of 50Â°. For VV polarization, the first-order amplitude and harmonic nonlinearities are always smaller than the corresponding values for HH polarization and are significant only at angles near vertical},

  abstract = {Measurements of the normalized radar cross section of the sea at K u band at an incidence angle of 10 deg; were performed from a manned airship off the Oregon coast in September and October of 1993. The cross section at this incidence angle is often assumed to have little dependence on windspeed and direction. Their measurements, however, indicate that at windspeeds below 6-7 m/s, the cross section is in fact dependent on these quantities, and the azimuthal modulation can reach values on the order of 5-8 dB. Comparisons of the measured values with the predictions of the quasispecular scattering model are presented. The theory is shown to be accurate in predicting the azimuthal modulation and the strength of the backscatter if the effects of swell are included or if measured wind directions are ignored and the upwind direction is forced to be near the maximum cross section. Values of mean-square wind-wave slope and effective-reflection coefficient required to obtain these fits are very close to those obtained by previous investigators. In particular, mean-square wind-wave slopes are about 70-80% of those of Cox and Munk (1954) because the radar responds only to facets larger than about 10 cm, with smaller ripples acting to reduce the reflection coefficient. If swell is included, they find that mean-square slopes in the direction of the swell, that are as much as ten times the measured swell slopes, are required to fit the model to the cross-section data at low windspeeds. They suggest that this may be due to high-order effects of the hydrodynamic modulation of short waves by the swell. They believe that this explanation is more likely than assuming that wind directions were incorrectly measured},

  abstract = {Abstract In this study, a two-dimensional variational analysis method (2DVAR) is applied to select a wind solution from NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) ambiguous winds. A 2DVAR method determines a âbestâ gridded surface wind analysis by minimizing a cost function. The cost function measures the misfit to the observations, the background, and the filtering and dynamical constraints. The ambiguity closest in direction to the minimizing analysis is selected. The 2DVAR method, sensitivity, and numerical behavior are described. 2DVAR is used with both NSCAT ambiguities and NSCAT backscatter values. Results are roughly comparable. When the background field is poor, 2DVAR ambiguity removal often selects low probability ambiguities. To avoid this behavior, an initial 2DVAR analysis, using only the two most likely ambiguities, provides the first guess for an analysis using all the ambiguities or the backscatter data. 2DVAR and median filter-selected ambiguities usually agree. Both methods require horizontal consistency, so disagreements occur in clumps, or as linear features. In these cases, 2DVAR ambiguities are often more meteorologically reasonable and more consistent with satellite imagery.},

  Abstract                 = {The mechanisms associated with tropical cyclone recurvature are investigated using a five-level primitive equation model and an idealized environment with characteristics observed in cyclone recurvature conditions. All cyclones moved generally with the flow in the lower and middle troposphere, but the precise motion occurs by a combination of divergence and of advection in both the horizontal and the vertical. The horizontal advection arises from a combination of the initial environmental flow and local changes from rearrangement of the potential vorticity field by cyclone-environment interaction (the so-called,Î² effect). The balance between these mechanisms changes as the vortex recurves. Since the gradients of potential vorticity increase sharply poleward of the subtropical ridge, this is the preferred region for development of an anticyclonic gyre. This gyre is advected eastward and becomes the dominant anticyclonic system. Recurvature is aided by horizontal deformation of the cyclone in the vicinity of this gyre, and by the manner in which the vertical tilt of the vortex and local divergence fields vary as it moves through a changing vertical wind shear of the environment. Recurvature is sensitive to the degree of diabatic heating and to small meridional changes in the initial vortex location. It is shown that recurvature can occur through an initially unbroken subtropical ridge, but that the presence of a midlatitude trough substantially enhances the potential for recurvature. However, while changes in the upper troposphere are indicative of recurvature potential, recurvature is accomplished largely by lower-tropospheric changes. An important component of this change is the development of a major anticyclone poleward and eastward of the cyclone. A recent observational study by Ford et al. concurs with this finding.},

To extract the brightness temperature of the water from the antenna temperature, an unstable Fredholm integral equation of the first kind is solved. Fourier transform techniques are used to invert the integral after it is placed into a cross correlation form. Application and verification of the methods to a two-dimensional modeling of a laboratory wave tank system are included. The instability of the ill-posed Fredholm equation is examined and a restoration procedure is included which smooths the resulting oscillations. With the recent availability and advances of fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, the method presented becomes very attractive in the evaluation of large quantities of data. Actual radiometric measurements of sea water are inverted using the restoration method, incorporating the advantages of the FFT algorithm for computations.},

  Abstract                 = {The high spatial resolution and large coverage of satellite-based synthetic aperture radars (SAR) offers a unique opportunity to derive mesoscale wind fields over the ocean surface, providing high resolution wind fields near the shore. For this purpose, algorithms were developed and tested using the ScanSAR aboard the Canadian satellite RADARSAT-1, operating at C-band with horizontal polarization in transmit and receive. Wind directions are extracted from wind-induced streaks visible on most SAR images. Wind speeds are derived from normalized radar cross sections (NRCS) using empirical models. The models were developed for scatterometers (SCAT) operating at C-band with vertical polarization and must be modified for horizontal polarization. Several available C-band polarization ratios were considered, including theoretical and empirical forms. To verify and improve the algorithm, wind speeds were computed from several RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR images and compared to colocated measurements from the SCAT aboard the European remote sensing satellite ERS-2 and to the results of the Danish high resolution limited area model (HIRLAM). Using the colocated measurements, the polarization ratio was estimated and applied to improve the wind retrieval algorithm. In addition, the main error sources in SAR wind field extraction are discussed with respect to the RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR data. Sensitivity studies were performed under different atmospheric situations using the modified C-band model to compute the errors due to wind direction and inaccuracies in NRCS},

  Abstract                 = {Precipitation affects many aspects of our everyday life. It is the primary source of freshwater and has significant socioeconomic impacts resulting from natural hazards such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and landslides. Fundamentally, precipitation is a critical component of the global water and energy cycle that governs the weather, climate, and ecological systems. Accurate and timely knowledge of when, where, and how much it rains or snows is essential for understanding how the Earth system functions and for improving the prediction of weather, climate, freshwater resources, and natural hazard events. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission is an international satellite mission specifically designed to set a new standard for the measurement of precipitation from space and to provide a new generation of global rainfall and snowfall observations in all parts of the world every 3 h. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA) successfully launched the Core Observatory satellite on 28 February 2014 carrying advanced radar and radiometer systems to serve as a precipitation physics observatory. This will serve as a transfer standard for improving the accuracy and consistency of precipitation measurements from a constellation of research and operational satellites provided by a consortium of international partners. GPM will provide key measurements for understanding the global water and energy cycle in a changing climate as well as timely information useful for a range of regional and global societal applications such as numerical weather prediction, natural hazard monitoring, freshwater resource management, and crop forecasting.},

For better understanding the scattering behavior from randomly rough surfaces, the information about scattering must be known omnidirectionally, not just in the specular or backscatter direction. The objective of this paper is to examine the bistatic scattering characteristics from randomly rough surfaces along the different azimuth angles. Comparisons between the model prediction and the experimental measurements are made for both like and cross polarizations. This model prediction demonstrates good agreement with experimental data},

This paper presents an extended error analysis of the estimation of Tv, Th, and TQ equiv Tv - Th by Yueh's method. In order to carry out the analysis, we first develop a forward model of polarization rotation that accounts for the random nature of thermal radiation, receiver noise, and (to first order) calibration. Analytic formulas are then derived for the bias, standard deviation (STD), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of estimated TQ, Tv, and Th, as functions of scene and radiometer parameters. These formulas are validated through independent calculation via Monte Carlo simulation. Examination of the formulas reveals that: 1) natural TU from planetary surface radiation, of the magnitude expected on Earth at L-band, has a negligible effect on correction for polarization rotation; 2) RMSE is a function of rotation angle Omega, but the value of Omega that minimizes RMSE is not known prior to instrument fabrication; and 3) if residual calibration errors can be sufficiently reduced via postlaunch calibration, then Yueh's method reduces the error incurred by polarization rotation to negligibility.},

  abstract = {Abstract The standard model for sea ice dynamics treats the ice pack as a viscoâplastic material that flows plastically under typical stress conditions but behaves as a linear viscous fluid where strain rates are small and the ice becomes nearly rigid. Because of large viscosities in these regions, implicit numerical methods are necessary for time steps larger than a few seconds. Current solution methods for these equations use iterative relaxation methods, which are time consuming, scale poorly with mesh resolution, and are not well adapted to parallel computation. To remedy this, the authors developed and tested two separate methods. First, by demonstrating that the viscousâplastic rheology can be represented by a symmetric, negative definite matrix operator, the much faster and better behaved preconditioned conjugate gradient method was implemented. Second, realizing that only the response of the ice on timescales associated with wind forcing need be accurately resolved, the model was modified so that it reduces to the viscousâplastic model at these timescales, whereas at shorter timescales the adjustment process takes place by a numerically more efficient elastic wave mechanism. This modification leads to a fully explicit numerical scheme that further improves the modelâs computational efficiency and is a great advantage for implementations on parallel machines. Furthermore, it is observed that the standard viscousâplastic model has poor dynamic response to forcing on a daily timescale, given the standard time step (1 day) used by the ice modeling community. In contrast, the explicit discretization of the elastic wave mechanism allows the elasticâviscousâplastic model to capture the ice response to variations in the imposed stress more accurately. Thus, the elasticâviscousâplastic model provides more accurate results for shorter timescales associated with physical forcing, reproduces viscousâplastic model behavior on longer timescales, and is computationally more efficient overall.},

  abstract = {An analytical expression of the effective energy transfer velocity relating surface wind stress and energy dissipation is derived from the parameterization functions of wave energy dissipation and ocean surface friction coefficient. The equation is applied to analyses from two field experiments at very different stages of wave development. Discussions on relevant issues such as the effect of wind field steadiness, scaling, and spectral resolution are presented. A key result from this investigation is that the effective energy transfer velocity is confined in a narrow range, with the majority of data points within 1.5 and 3 m/s, over a wide range of wind speed (5\&{\#}8211;16 m/s) and dimensionless frequency (0.8\&{\#}8211;4.2) of the wavefield. A sharp increase in the energy transfer coefficient and effective energy transfer velocity occurs at a wind speed near 6 or 7 m/s. Data points that deviated significantly from the parameterization prediction appear to be associated with wind field unsteadiness, which is not accounted for in the formulation of parameterization function. The breaking process is local in space or time as well as in wave number or frequency. Global (mean) quantities such as dominant wave speed and wind friction velocity are not the proper scaling factor for the breaking velocity or energy transfer coefficient. The scaling factor should reflect the local characteristics (steepness, acceleration, or orbital velocity) of the wavefield that lead to waveform instability.},

  Abstract                 = {Field measurements of the ocean surface wave spectrum focusing on the slope-contributing components are used to construct a spectral model of the ocean surface roughness. The spectral parameterization is established with the observed empirical power law relation between the dimensionless wave spectral density and wind speed. The power law parameters (proportionality coefficient and exponent) are shown to be modified by swell. Discussions are presented on the swell effects of spectral properties, including their wind speed dependence and swell modification of roughness components characterizing Bragg resonance and surface tilting in radar application. Several notable results include the following: (1) With increasing swell intensity, the spectral density increases in the long-wave portion and decreases in the short-wave portion of the intermediate-scale waves. (2) There is a nodal point with respect to swell impact in the wave number dependence of the coefficient and exponent of the spectral parameterization function in the vicinity of wave number near 3 rad/m, suggesting that waves about a couple of meters long are insensitive to swell influence. (3) Spectral density in the decimeter length scale becomes less sensitive to wind speed variation as swell intensity increases. (4) Increasing swell influence shifts wave breaking toward shorter and broader scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Field data indicate convincingly that the drag coefficient of the ocean surface is sea-state dependent. As a result, under steady forcing by a constant wind velocity the wind stress on the ocean surface varies with time. It also varies with space if the wave development is limited by fetch. A quantitative estimation of the temporal and spatial variation of the wind stress produced by a constant wind velocity is presented. The method of computation combines the duration- or fetch-limited growth functions of wind-generated waves and the similarity relation of the ocean-surface drag coefficient derived from wavelength scaling. The only required input is the wind speed. The results indicate that the average momentum flux from atmosphere to ocean is much larger (about 50 to 100 percent higher, and especially for shorter wind events) in comparison with calculations using the drag coefficient or dynamic roughness formulated either without the wave parameters or based on steady state wave conditions.},

The main result of the analysis is that the dependence of the dimensionless wave spectrum on the dimensionless wind friction velocity follows a power law function. The coefficient and exponent of the power law function vary systematically with the wave number. The wave number dependence of the coefficient and exponent serves as an empirical parameterization for computing the wave number spectra of intermediate-scale waves at different wind speeds. Calculation of the mean square slope from the resulting wave number spectrum confirms that intermediate-scale waves are the dominant contributor of the ocean surface roughness. A simple formula is presented for calculating the band-pass filtered mean square slope of the ocean surface for remote sensing applications.},

Its primary contribution is from surface waves much shorter than the energetic wave components near the peak of the wave energy spectrum. Field measurements of short-scale waves are scarce. In contrast, microwave remote sensing has produced a large volume of data useful for short-wave investigation. Particularly, Bragg resonance is the primary mechanism of radar backscatter from the ocean surface and the radar serves as a spectrometer of short surface waves. The roughness spectra inverted from radar backscatter measurements expand the short-wave database to high wind conditions in which in situ sensors do not function well. Using scatterometer geophysical model functions for L-, C-, and Ku-band microwave frequencies, the inverted roughness spectra, covering Bragg resonance wavelengths from 0.012 to 0.20 m, show a convergent trend in high winds. This convergent trend is incorporated in the surface roughness spectrum model to improve the applicable wind speed range for microwave scattering and emission computations.},

  Abstract                 = {The spectrum of ocean surface roughness is significantly modified by the presence of background long waves not generated by local wind. Active radar scattering and passive microwave emission from the ocean surface are therefore modified by swell conditions. Here we investigate predictions of the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) of the sea by a multiscale radar scattering model using four different spectral functions, one of which accounts for swell effects. Variations in predicted NRCS using the different spectral functions are quantified. As a result, the effect of swell on microwave backscatter can be separated from uncertainty due to the form of the spectrum without swell. The tilting effects of swell are also examined, and their effect on backscatter is calculated using the model. We find that changes in the ocean surface roughness spectrum due to swell reduce the wind speed dependence of the NRCS at low and moderate incidence angles while tilting effects produce changes in both the incidence angle and wind speed behavior of the NRCS. In general C band NRCS measurements are better explained by the multiscale model and less sensitive to choice of roughness spectral model than are Ku band NRCS values.},

  Abstract                 = {The energy dissipation per unit area of the ocean surface attributed to fetch- or duration-limited wind-generated waves can be expressed in terms of wind speed, significant wave height and peak wave frequency. Such a parameterization equation can be exploited for obtaining a first order estimation of the rate of energy input through the air-sea interface in the world's oceans using satellite output of wind speed, wave height and wave period. For general wind wave events in the ocean with event duration longer than one hour, the energy dissipation (in W/m2) is equal to the product of the density of air, wind speed cubed and a proportionality coefficient between 0.00037 and 0.00057. Using the equation to calculate the wave energy dissipation, the whitecap coverage is proportional linearly to the energy dissipation. The threshold energy dissipation for whitecap inception is between 0.013 and 0.038 W/m2, which corresponds to a threshold wind speed of between 2.5 and 3.6 m/s. The proportionality coefficient is relatively constant for a wide range of wave growth conditions in comparison to the data scatter in the whitecap measurements. This may explain why it is so difficult to establish an unequivocal dependence on the explicit surface wave parameters in the whitecap data. The weak explicit wave signal can be detected after the cubic wind speed dependence is removed.},

Its oscillatory component is contributed by ocean waves. The peak component of the Doppler velocity spectrum can be used to obtain the spectral peak wave period and the significant wave height can be calculated from the variance of the Doppler velocity.

  Abstract                 = {Low-grazing angle backscattering data collected by a coherent dual-polarized radar installed on a fixed tower in the ocean are analyzed to investigate the properties of sea spikes attributable to wave breaking. The distribution of breaking wave speed is narrow-banded with an average speed between 2.0 and 2.6 m/s in mixed seas with wind speeds between 7 and 14.5 m/s. The corresponding breaking wavelength is between 2.5 and 4.3 m. The length or velocity scale of wave breaking is not proportional to the length or velocity scale of the dominant wave. This observation reflects the localized nature of the breaking process and may have significant implications on quantifying various breaking properties such as the energy dissipation or area of turnover by breaking waves. The fraction of sea spike coverage generally increases with wind speed but the trend of increase is modified by the intensity and relative direction of background swell. Parameterizations of sea spike coverage needs to take into consideration both wind and wave factors. Similarities and differences between sea spikes and whitecaps are discussed. In particular, while both quantities show a similar power law dependence on wind speed, the fraction of sea spike coverage is considerably higher than that of whitecap coverage. This result reflects the prevalence of steep features that produce quasi-specular facets and short-scale waves bounded to intermediate waves during breaking. These quasi-specular facets and bound waves contribute significantly to enhancing the radar sea return but may not entrain air to produce whitecap signature.},

  Abstract                 = {The capability of spaceborne altimeters to provide precise measurement of significant wave height and wind speed has been demonstrated repeatedly. It is shown in this paper that in addition to the significant wave height and wind speed, the wave period can be calculated from the semiempirical functions established from earlier wave research. The calculated characteristic wave period using the altimeter-derived wind speed and wave height are found to be in excellent agreement with the peak wave period and average wave period from the ocean buoy measurements in the Gulf of Mexico. Also, with the long time series of collocated data set, it is possible to compare altimeter output of wind and wave parameters with ocean buoy measurements taking into consideration the spatial lags between the buoy locations and the altimeter footprints, and the temporal lags between the two sensor systems. It is found that when the spatial lags are less than 10 km, the RMS difference of the significant wave height is approximately 0.1 m, which is the digitization resolution of the output from both altimeter and ocean buoy. For the wind speed, the RMS difference approaches 1.2 m/s in the Gulf of Mexico using the empirical algorithms. The wind speed agreement is significantly improved to 0.8 m/s when the tilting effect on the altimeter cross section is accounted for. In contrast to the spatial lags, temporal lags of up to 1 hour do not appear to produce significant difference in the statistics of comparison based on this study.},

  Abstract                 = {A dual-beam interferometric synthetic aperture radar measures remotely two radial components of the ocean surface current from a single flight pass. Combining two passes over the same area, all three orthogonal components of the surface velocity can be retrieved. An experiment is conducted near the Gulf Stream (GS) boundary. A sharp change of the surface velocity of about 1 m/s over a 500 m lateral distance is measured. The wind and wave condition is dominated by a 14-s swell system and low wind velocity. The wave variance inside GS is about twice the wave variance outside the GS in the present data set. The difference in the wave variance is considerably higher than that can be expected from wave-current interaction. An ocean current system with strong shears such as the GS is a wave guide and can trap waves with the right combinations of wavelengths and propagation directions. Numerical calculations suggest that the wave properties of the data set may satisfy the conditions of wave trapping by the GS. The standing wave pattern on the GS side of the sharp velocity front, indicative of the long swell bouncing off the current front, also offers support for the wave guide hypothesis. In this respect, the Gulf Stream can be considered the nature's hydraulic breakwater that can attenuate about 50{\%} of the incident wave energy generated by storms. Its role in protecting the U.S. coastlines in the Atlantic Ocean cannot be overstated.},

  Abstract                 = {Depolarized (de-pol) radar backscatter is now produced by many spaceborne satellites. Analysis of RADARSAT-2 (R2) quad-polarization (quad-pol) data with collocated in situ ocean wind measurements reveals that the de-pol radar backscatter does not saturate in high winds. This is a significant development for radar wind sensing, because wind retrieval with copolarized (co-pol) backscatter suffers from problems of incidence-and-azimuth-angle-dependent signal saturation and dampening in high winds. We present a study comparing satellite quad-pol measurements with the composite surface Bragg (CB) theory of radar backscattering from the ocean surface. The co-pol data are in good agreement with the CB theory. De-pol data are more sensitive to wind speed compared to theoretical prediction, thus retrieval of high winds is more accurate using the de-pol return. The cubic wind speed dependence of de-pol returns in high winds reflects the significant breaking wave contributions. The relationship can be used to obtain wave-breaking properties from space.},

Semi-analytical SSS correction models, as used in the soil moisture and ocean salinity satellite Level 2 processor, combine an emissivity model with an ocean wave spectrum model that describes the rough sea surface. Previous findings indicate that the errors contributed by ocean roughness model exceed those of the emissivity model. In this paper, we compare the performance of three well-known spectrum models and a new one as inputs to the small slope approximation/small perturbation method emissivity model. The new spectrum model, which is developed from empirical parameterization of short water wave spectra measured in the ocean and incorporates swell effects, performs very well in comparison with the other spectrum models, and we propose its consideration for future SSS roughness correction models.},

  Abstract                 = {A consistent radiometric model of the ocean is important for interpretation of the passive microwave remote sensing data. Empirical relations between measured brightness temperature and environmental parameters such as wind, surface temperature, salinity, etc. are often used for processing of satellite and airborne data. That approach has some problems when a non-stationary environment is studied, such as variable in time and space wind or/and surface currents. In this case a consistent model based on physical parameters of the sea surface and atmosphere is needed. We consider a radiometric model of the ocean based on a wave action balance equation. We modified the source term to account for parasitic ripples. Along with surface roughness the model provides wave breaking statistics and foam coverage, which is especially important for microwave radiometry due to high foam emissivity. Comparison shows good agreement between model prediction and experimental observations},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we examine the emerging potential offered by satellite microwave radiometer SST measurements to complement altimeter data to quantitatively derive surface ocean currents. The proposed methodology does not follow standard sequential temporal analysis but follows the application of the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) theory. Accordingly, under favourable environmental conditions, the implementation for this methodology is simple and robust, and most importantly, solely requires a single SST image. For the present demonstration, altimetric measurements are used to infer a necessary adjustment to match the kinetic energy level for length scales smaller than 300 km. This helps to derive a regional effective Brunt-V\'eis\'el\'e frequency to produce SQG surface current estimates. As demonstrated, the results are very encouraging and strongly invite to consider the systematic use of satellite microwave radiometer measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of the ocean by an effective version of Surface Quasi-Geostrophy (eSQG) is examined. Using the fact that surface density plays an analogous role as interior potential vorticity (PV), the eSQG method consists in inverting the QG PV generated by sea-surface density only. We also make the extra assumption that sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies fully represent surface density anomalies. This approach requires a single snapshot of SST and the setup of two parameters: the mean Brunt-V\'eis\'el\'e frequency and a parameter that determines the energy level at the ocean surface. The validity of this approach is tested using an Ocean General Circulation Model simulation representing the North Atlantic in winter. It is shown that the method is quite successful in reconstructing the velocity field at the ocean surface for mesoscales (between 30 and 300 km). The eSQG framework can also be applied to reconstruct subsurface fields using surface information. Results show that the reconstruction of velocities and vorticity from surface fields is reasonably good for the upper 500 m and that the success of the method mainly depends on the quality of the SST as a proxy of the density anomaly at the base of the mixed layer. This situation happens after a mixed-layer deepening period. Therefore the ideal situation for the application of this method would be after strong wind events.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we investigate the validity of the multifractal formalism to study sea surface temperature (SST). It is shown that SST patterns observed in moderate resolution SST images have anomalous scaling properties characteristic of a multifractal structure. The most probable origin of the observed structures is the turbulent character of the oceanic flow as they evolve slowly and are very persistent in times compatible with ocean mesoscale dynamics (several days). The spectrum of singularity exponents indicates that the dynamics of the processes leading to the geometrical arrangement of the SST patterns is quite general over the available range of scales. As a consequence, multifractal techniques can be used to extract properties of the underlying flow. In particular, the geometry of the SST multifractal components is closely linked with the ocean flow, which allows to build a reasonable guess of the streamfunction (defined as the maximum singular streamfunction (MSS)) from a single SST image. Thus the ocean surface velocity field can be easily inferred, with some limitations. As multifractal analysis is in essence a geometrical approach, the method is able to retrieve a high resolution velocity field, well localized in space, but with some indetermination on the modulus and sense of velocity vectors. To solve this, a general framework for the integration of extra information is proposed, what is illustrated with an example merging MSS with altimetric data.},

  Abstract                 = {An objective analysis of monthly ocean subsurface temperatures from 1950 to 1998 is carried out. The analysis scheme and the results with estimated analysis errors are presented. The analysis domain is global with a horizontal grid of 1Â° Ã 1Â° and 14 vertical levels in the upper 500 m. Subsurface temperature observations used in the objective analysis are archived by the National Ocean Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, together with those collected through the global telecommunication system and domestic communication lines in Japan. All the observations are preprocessed by quality control and data selection procedures developed in this study. Together with these observations, three-dimensional fields of the upper-ocean temperature are optimally estimated using a variational technique. To ensure smooth and continuous vertical temperature profiles, a constraint term is introduced to the cost function that is minimized in the analysis. In addition, the analysis scheme is formulated to constrain mixed layer temperatures to become close to sea surface temperatures produced by the Met Office. The three-dimensional structure of thermal anomalies is represented by the objective analysis. Interannual variations of temperature anomalies in the northern and tropical Pacific are presented and examined with the estimated errors. For the purpose of verification against independent observations of the objective analysis, dynamical heights estimated from the analyzed temperatures and climatological salinity are compared with tide gauge and sea surface height observations. An investigation of analysis errors and signal-to-noise (S-N) ratio reveals that the reliability increases in the tropical Pacific since the 1970s and the S-N ratio for seasonally averaged temperatures in a 3Â° latitude Ã 6Â° longitude box at 100-m depth is 2.5 in the 1990s. This is not only due to the increase in data sampling but also to an increase in interannual variances of subsurface temperature. At midlatitudes of the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere, the S-N ratio is above (below) unity over the whole period of the objective analysis. The changes are very small in these 50 yr. although recent observational networks cover the global oceans better and the observations are more homogeneously distributed than those of the previous decades.},

Our work at NASA Goddard, both experimental and theoretical, leads us to believe that we have found a simple, accurate, and economical solution to the global waves measurement problem. With some relatively minor modifications, these measurements can be made with existing satellite radar altimeters operating in a conical scan mode near nadir. The predictions of theory are confirmed by an extensive set of aircraft flight data. This paper provides a brief overview of our work in its historical context.},

Of the satellite sensors, there has been only one instrument that provides any heritage at L band, the Skylab S-194 instrument that operated in the 1970s. Data from theses missions have been analyzed and reported in a few applications, however, these studies utilized either the linear regression approach or the Antecedent Precipitation Index (API). We explore the use of products from climate model reanalysis projects as ancillary data to exploit the S-194 data for a broad range of soil moisture conditions by employing a radiative transfer approach. The spatial resolution and the accuracy of reanalysis outputs are major limitations to this approach.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model for non-Rayleigh microwave sea echo is developed which describes explicitly the dependence of statistical properties of the radar cross section on the area of sea surface illuminated by the radar. In addition to the first probability distribution of the scattered radiation, its temporal and spatial correlation functions are also considered. It is shown that, in general, these correlation functions decay on at least two scales, the second, non-Rayleigh, contributions being strongly dependent on the properties of a "single scatterer." Predictions of the model are found to be in qualitative agreement with existing experimental data. A new class of probability distributions, the "K-distributions," is introduced, which may prove useful for fitting such data.},

  Abstract                 = {The VIERS-1 (Verification and Interpretation ERS-1) project has resulted in a new algorithm for the interpretation of the wind scatterometer, based on a physical model of air/sea/radar interaction in which the radar backscatter is calculated from wind and wave conditions. The model is inverted to obtain the wind from the radar backscatter. For operational purposes the model was coupled to the WAM wave model, which provides first-guess wave information. The performance of VIERS-1 has been compared with that of CMOD4, the algorithm presently in operational use, which is mainly based on statistical fitting. Using operational data it has been found that the results of VIERS-1 were comparable with those of CMOD4, with VIERS-1 outperforming CMOD4 slightly at both high and low wind speeds, but with CMOD4 providing a somewhat closer fit in backscatter space.},

  Abstract                 = {During the last decade, the TOPEX/Poseidon mission has provided a wealth of data pertaining to total electron content (TEC) measurements over the oceans, where conventional measurements are sparse. In this study, a comprehensive comparison of the TOPEX TEC measurements with the recent version of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-2001) was performed. The study covered solar cycle, seasonal, geomagnetic activity, and longitudinal variations. First, it was found that both the IRI and TOPEX TEC show a negligibly small geomagnetic dependency, regardless of the solar activity and seasonal conditions. For solar activity, however, not only the TECs from the IRI and TOPEX measurements, but also the difference between them, strongly depend on the solar activity. The comparison also shows that the daytime low-latitude ionosphere from the IRI always develops earlier than the corresponding TOPEX measurements, appearing as an overestimate of IRI TEC at around 7 magnetic local time (MLT) in the morning. With respect to the annual and seasonal variations of TEC, the TOPEX TEC shows stronger annual and semiannual anomalies than the IRI TEC both at low latitudes and at upper mid-latitudes. However, the IRI and TOPEX TECs show a similar seasonal anomaly only for high solar activity. Finally, the longitudinal variations of the IRI TEC show good agreement with the TOPEX measurements for low solar activity, but for high solar activity, large discrepancies occur in the Pacific sector.},

  abstract = {The propagation of spaceborne radar signals operating at L-band frequency or below can be seriously affected by the ionosphere. At high states of solar activity, Faraday rotation (FR) and signal path delays disturb radar polarimetry and reduce resolution in range and azimuth. While these effects are negligible at X-band, FR and the frequency-dependent path delays can become seriously problematic starting at L-band. For quality assurance and calibration purposes, existing L-band or potential spaceborne P-band missions require the estimation of the ionospheric state before or during the data take. This paper introduces two approaches for measuring the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) from single-polarized spaceborne SAR data. The two methods are demonstrated using simulations. Both methods leverage knowledge of the frequency-dependent path delay through the ionosphere: The first estimates TEC from the phase error of the filter mismatch, while the second gauges path-delay differences between up and down chirps. FR, mean (direct current) offsets, and noise contributions are also considered in the simulations. Finally, possibilities for further methodological improvements are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The surface signatures of meandering fronts and eddies have been regularly observed and documented in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Wave-current interactions, the suppression of short wind waves by natural film, and the varying wind field resulting from atmospheric boundary layer changes across an oceanic temperature front all contribute to the radar image manifestation of such mesoscale features. The corresponding imaging mechanisms are quantitatively explored using a new radar imaging model (Kudryavtsev et al., 2005) that solves the energy balance equation where wind forcing, viscous and wave breaking dissipation, wave-wave interactions, and generation of short waves by breaking waves are taken into account. High-quality and synoptic in situ observations of the surface conditions should ideally be used in this model. However, such data are rarely available. Instead, the fields of temperature and ocean current are herein derived from two distinct numerical ocean models. SAR image expressions of current fronts and eddies are then simulated based on these fields. The comparison of simulated images with European Remote Sensing (ERS) SAR and Envisat advanced SAR (ASAR) images is favorable. We consequently believe that the new radar imaging model provides promising capabilities for advancing the quantitative interpretation of current features manifested in SAR images.},

  Abstract                 = {Climatological surface salinities and satellite-derived surface currents are combined to estimate the horizontal and vertical time mean and seasonal salinity divergence in the tropical ocean's surface layer. The mean salinity divergence has magnitude and spatial patterns matching major features of an estimate of evaporation minus precipitation averaged from several atmospheric general circulation model reanalyses and satellite-derived products (spatial correlation of 0.63). Thus a substantial portion of the atmospheric freshwater flux appears to be balanced by ocean transports in a relatively thin (32.5 m) surface layer. Large regional discrepancies remain, however, and their magnitude is greater than the scatter among the various atmospheric forcing products used in this study. The present salinity divergence calculation is imprecise because the mean salinity gradients have been weakened by large-scale smoothing of sparse and unevenly sampled data. Further, other investigators show that higher-frequency ocean processes (e.g., vertical and horizontal mixing of salinity) are significant at least locally. Nevertheless, several areas of consistent disagreement between mean flow salinity divergence and atmospheric forcing, such as excess evaporation in subtropical gyres, are suggestive of errors in the forcing. In particular, the shortfall of salinity convergence balancing high precipitation in the western Pacific is roughly consistent with regional surface flux corrections required to bring ocean general circulation model integrations into long-term balance in this region. Thus this shortfall may reflect either overlarge precipitation estimates or a fundamental misunderstanding of how the ocean disperses this flux. Ultimately, further ocean physics must be addressed before firm conclusions can be drawn about the fraction of atmospheric freshwater input unaccounted for by the near-surface mean flow and seasonal salinity divergence. High-resolution space-based salinity measurements will be necessary to provide the temporal and spatial coverage necessary to develop ocean salinity transport calculations into useful constraints on ocean processes, surface hydrological forcing, and model simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {The subtropical cells (STCs) cycle subtropically subducted water to the equator, where it upwells and flows pole ward at the surface, exchanging heat and freshwater with the atmosphere. Pacific STC surface flow is analyzed using drifter data. Mean surface velocities are estimated. The mean divergence reveals substantial equatorial upwelling. Off-equatorial downwelling around Â±4Â° latitude suggests that about half the upwelled water may recirculate in shallow tropical cells. Pathways and time scales for the poleward surface limb of the STC are estimated. Mean streamlines reach Â±9Â° latitude after half a year and Â±22Â° after 2 years, taking a more convoluted path in the northern hemisphere. They reenter the subtropics in the western half of the basin, far from the subduction regions feeding the equatorward limbs of the STCs, reinforcing the point that the STCs are intrinsically linked with the global ocean circulation.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent El NiÃ±oâLa NiÃ±a cycle exhibited striking patterns of current and salinity variability in the upper equatorial Pacific Ocean. This evolution is described from mid-1996 through 1998 using a remarkable data set of 35 meridional conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD)/acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) sections along with buoy data. The sections, nominally from 8Â°S to 8Â°N between 165Â°E and 95Â°W, were occupied over the course of 27 months. A wide range of current variability was sampled with currents that appeared or disappeared some time during the cycle, including an equatorially trapped eastward surface current, the Equatorial Undercurrent, the northern branch of the South Equatorial Current, and the North Equatorial Countercurrent. Basin-wide, interannual changes in upper ocean and pycnocline zonal transports were as large as 64Â±32Ã106 m3 sâ1. Changes in the salinity structure included a deep and fresh mixed layer in the central equatorial Pacific that built up during the El NiÃ±o and was then disrupted by upwelled salty water with the onset of La NiÃ±a, a very fresh mixed layer observed in the eastern equatorial Pacific late in the El NiÃ±o, and a reduction in the strength of the meridional equatorial salinity gradient within the pycnocline to one third of the usual value during the El NiÃ±o. Finally, the zonal transports above the thermocline from 5Â°S to 5Â°N were well correlated with the rate of change of warm-water volume west of the individual CTD/ADCP sections.},

  Abstract                 = {Temperature and salinity both contribute to ocean density, including its seasonal cycle and spatial patterns in the mixed layer. Temperature and salinity profiles from the Argo Program allow construction and analysis of a global, monthly, mixed layer climatology. Temperature changes dominate the seasonal cycle of mixed layer density in most regions, but salinity changes are dominant in the tropical warm pools, Arctic, and Antarctic. Under the Intertropical Convergence Zone, temperature and salinity work in concert to increase seasonal stratification, but the seasonal density changes there are weak because the temperature and salinity changes are small. In the eastern subtropics, seasonal salinity changes partly compensate those in temperature and reduce seasonal mixed layer density changes. Besides a hemispheric seasonal reversal, the times of maximum and minimum mixed layer density exhibit regional variations. For instance, the equatorial region is more closely aligned with Southern Hemisphere timing, and much of the North Indian Ocean has a minimum density in May and June. Outside of the tropics, the maximum mixed layer density occurs later in the winter toward the poles, and the minimum earlier in the summer. Finally, at the times of maximum mixed layer density, some of the ocean has horizontal temperature and salinity gradients that work against each other to reduce the horizontal density gradient. However, on the equatorial sides of the subtropical salinity maxima, temperature and salinity gradients reinforce each other, increasing the density gradients there. Density gradients are generally stronger where either salinity or temperature gradients are dominant influences.},

  Abstract                 = {A numerical study of 14-GHz backscattering from ocean-like surfaces, described by a Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum, is presented. Surfaces rough in one and two dimensions are investigated, with Monte Carlo simulations performed efficiently through the use of the canonical-grid expansion in an iterative method of moments. Backscattering cross sections are illustrated for perfectly conducting surfaces at angles from 0 to 60Â° from normal incidence, and the efficiency of the numerical model enables the composite surface theory to be studied in the microwave frequency range for realistic one-dimensional (1D) surface profiles at low wind speeds (3 m/s). Variations with surface spectrum low-frequency cutoff (ranging over spatial lengths from 21.9 to 4.29 cm) are investigated to obtain an assessment of composite surface model accuracy. The 1D surface results show an increase in hh backscatter returns as surface low-frequency content is increased for incidence angles larger than 30Â°, while Î½Î½ returns remain relatively constant, all as predicted by the composite surface model. Similar results are obtained for surfaces rough in two dimensions, although the increased computational complexity allows maximum surface sizes of only 1.37 m to be considered. In addition, cross-polarized cross sections are studied in the two-dimensional (2D) surface case and again found to increase as surface low-frequency content is increased. For both 1D and 2D surfaces, backscattering cross sections within 20Â° of normal incidence are found to be well matched by both Monte Carlo and analytical physical optics (PO) methods for all low-frequency cutoffs considered, and a comparison of analytical PO and geometrical optics (GO) results indicates an appropriate choice of the cutoff wavenumber in the composite surface model to insure an accurate slope variance for use in GO predictions. This choice of cutoff wavenumber is then applied in the composite surface theory for more realistic ocean spectra and compared with available experimental data},

  Abstract                 = {Corruption of C-band microwave brightness observations by radio-frequency interference (RFI) has been reported in recent data from orbiting radiometers; methods for mitigating these effects are of great importance for the design of future spaceborne microwave radiometers. One approach that has been suggested involves the use of multiple subchannels at C-band as opposed to a single channel; the use of multiple subchannels allows RFI to be detected and mitigated by analyzing relationships among subchannel brightnesses. While this approach has been utilized in previous airborne measurements, demonstrations of the RFI mitigation performance achieved have been difficult to obtain. To address this issue, an enhanced airborne system for observing radio-frequency interference effects on C-band microwave radiometers was developed, and is described in this paper. The system includes a traditional microwave radiometer with four C-band subchannels, so that RFI removal is possible using a subchannel mitigation algorithm. In addition, the system includes a digital receiver with the capability of providing high temporal and spectral resolution observations of interference. This high-resolution data allows improved understanding of RFI sources to be obtained, and also allows analysis of subchannel mitigation algorithm performance. Observations using the system in a test flight near Wallops Island, VA are described. Results show the four subchannel approach generally to be effective in mitigating the observed RFI sources, although examples are also illustrated using the digital receiver data to demonstrate failure of this approach. While studies of the digital receiver data alone could be performed to demonstrate further improvements in RFI mitigation, issues with this initial dataset limit the extent of such studies. Nevertheless, the results obtained still demonstrate qualitatively the improved RFI mitigation that can be achieved in brightness observations through the use of digit- - al receivers},

  Abstract                 = {From the mid 1960s to the present, the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) of the ocean has been measured using airborne radars operating over a frequency range of 0.4 to 14 GHz. Analyses of these data have shown that the NRCS was proportional to the ocean surface wind speed raised to some power, but the values of the exponent remained in dispute. This paper extends previous work and uses these NRCS measurements to demonstrate that to the first order, the NRCS is a function of only the friction velocity at the ocean's surface. Further analyses characterize the dependence of the NRCS on radar variables such as frequency, incidence angle, polarization, etc. Finally, recommendations are made for using Ku-band radars at large incidence angles for remote sensing of the wind friction velocity vector.},

  Abstract                 = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission launched in November 2009 will provide, for the first time, satellite observations of sea surface salinity (SSS). At level 3 (L3) of the SMOS processing chain, the large amount of SSS data obtained by the satellite will be summarized in gridded products with the aim of synthesizing the information and reducing the error of individual SSS observations. In this paper, we present the algorithm adopted by the CP34 SMOS processing center to generate the SMOS L3 products and discuss the choices adopted. The algorithm is based on optimal statistical interpolation. This method needs the following: 1) the prescription of a background field; 2) a prefiltering procedure to reduce the data set size; 3) the definition of a suitable correlation model; and 4) the characterization of the observational error statistics. For the present initial stage, a monthly climatology is chosen as the best background field. The spatiotemporal correlations between the departures from the climatology are described using a bivariate Gaussian function. The correlation model parameters are obtained by fitting the function to the realistic ocean model data. The sensitivity experiments show that an accurate correlation model that permits local variations in the correlation parameters is the best option. The observational error statistics (bias, variance, and correlation) are addressed from the results of the SMOS level-2 processor simulator. Finally, several sensitivity experiments show that a bad prescription of observational errors in the L3 algorithm does result in a dramatic impact on the generation of L3 products.},

  abstract = {In a pilot attempt, the GECCO2 synthesis system is being used to investigate the impact of SMOS sea surface salinity (SSS) observations on estimates of SSS and freshwater fluxes. The paper focuses on the period 2010 - 2011, during which, in addition to traditional in situ and satellite observations, SMOS SSS is assimilated. A prior SMOS SSS error field is inferred through a comparison of the satellite data with in situ salinity data and reveals large biases (>1 g/kg) in the SMOS product near continents and in the Southern Ocean. Employing this error estimate in the assimilation procedure leads only to an insignificant impact of SMOS SSS on the estimated ocean state. However, when reducing the error artificially by a factor of 10, the SMOS data can be reproduced well in the interior ocean. In this case, the previously remaining positive model bias with respect to in situ salinity is changed to a negative bias while the misfit slightly increased. The clear freshening can be attributed to the SMOS bias with respect to in situ data. The associated increase in freshwater input in the tropical oceans enhances slightly the correspondence of the estimated fluxes to the independent satellite based estimate from HOAPS except for the South Pacific and South Atlantic. On short time scales, changes in the estimated surface salinity result primarily from changes in surface freshwater fluxes, while over longer periods ocean dynamics become increasingly more important for changing the near-surface salinity.},

  Abstract                 = {The year 2005 experienced several strong hurricanes intensifying in the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall that severely damaged the Gulf States, especially Hurricane Katrina. Remarkable similarities between sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) and major hurricane (categories 3 and higher) activity over the Gulf are identified. However, the intensification of individual hurricanes may not necessarily be temporally and spatially coincident with the distribution of warm waters or high sea surface temperature (SST). High SST values are found in advance of significant intensification of Hurricane Katrina. We emphasize that high SSTA which occurred at the right time and right place was conducive to the hurricane intensification. In particular, high SSTA in the northeastern quadrant of the storm track induced significant increases in surface latent heat fluxes (LHF) contributing to the rapid intensification of Katrina. We also compared and verified model simulations with buoy observations.},

The units measure the antenna temperature, which contributes to the average brightness temperature level of SMOS retrievals. We assess the radiometric resolution of the receivers, the similarity between their measurements, and their thermal stability. For these purposes, we use SMOS measurement data gathered during the first year of the orbital operations of the satellite, which was launched in November 2009. The main results from the analysis are that the units meet the design requirements with a margin. Also, we present a new thermal model for the radiometers to further enhance their stability.},

  Abstract                 = {An improved mixed layer model, based on second-moment closure of turbulence and suitable for application to oceanic and atmospheric mixed layers, is described. The model is tested against observational data from different locations in the global oceans, including high latitudes and tropics. The model belongs to the Mellor-Yamada hierarchy but incorporates recent findings from research on large eddy simulations and second-moment closure. The modified expansion of Galperin, Kantha, Hassid and Rosati (1988) that leads to a much simpler and more robust quasi-equilibrium turbulence model is employed instead of the original Mellor and Yamada (1974) model. Findings from ongoing research at the National Center for Atmospheric Research on large eddy simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer are utilized to improve parameterizations of pressure covariance terms in the second-moment closure. Shortwave solar radiation penetration is given careful treatment in the model so that the model is applicable to investigations of biological and photochemical processes in the upper ocean. But by far the major improvement is in the inclusion of the shear instability-induced mixing in the strongly stratified region below the oceanic mixed layer that leads to a more realistic and reliable mixed layer model that is suitable for application to a variety of geophysical mixed layers and circulation problems. The model appears to predict the mixing in the upper ocean well on a variety of time scales, from event scale storm-induced deepening and diurnal scale variability to seasonal time scales. With proper attention to the heat and salt balances in the upper ocean, it should be possible to use it for simulations of interannual variability as well. While the model validation has been primarily against oceanic mixed layer data sets, it is believed that the improvements can be readily incorporated into a model of the atmospheric boundary layer as well.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of streamline curvature on small-scale turbulence and vertical mixing in stratified fluids is the subject of this study. The roles of curvature and stratification in enhancing and suppressing turbulent mixing are explored using second-moment closure for turbulence. Governing equations for second moments are expressed in generalized orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, from which, through a series of approximations, simplified expressions are derived for second moments in the limit of small streamline curvature. The governing equations are then used to obtain a quasi-equilibrium turbulence model suited for application to atmospheric and oceanic mixed layers. A typical model application is illustrated by simulation of stratified flows over two-dimensional, idealized mountains and valleys. The limit of local equilibrium is further invoked to derive semi-analytical results for the enhancement and suppression of vertical turbulent mixing under the combined influence of stratification and curvature. It is shown that stabilizing curvature can drastically suppress turbulence even when the stratification is strongly destabilizing. Conversely, under strong stable stratification that would otherwise lead to total suppression of turbulence, destabilizing curvature can keep turbulence alive. Streamline curvature is also shown to significantly modify the Monin-Obukhov similarity laws for momentum and heat fluxes in the constant flux region of the atmospheric boundary layer. Finally, the need for observational data on curvature effects on mixing in stratified flows either in the laboratory or in flows over topography in the oceans and the atmosphere is highlighted.},

Major findings are as follows: (1) the combination of both ocean wave and current speeds can result in reductions in daily C D (>10%), but the notable impact of the latter is only evident in the tropical Pacific Ocean; (2) the presence of waves generally makes winds weaker and C D lower almost everywhere over the global ocean; (3) strong ocean currents near the western boundaries (Kuroshio and Gulf Stream) do not substantially influence C D since the winds and currents are not always aligned; and (4) the change in speed used in bulk flux parameterization also causes large changes in fluxes. Globally, the combined outcome of ocean currents and waves is to reduce C D by about (2%), but spatial variations (0% to 14%) do exist.},

  Abstract                 = {The geometrical theory of diffraction is an extension of geometrical optics which accounts for diffraction. It introduces diffracted rays in addition to the usual rays of geometrical optics. These rays are produced by incident rays which hit edges, corners, or vertices of boundary surfaces, or which graze such surfaces. Various laws of diffraction, analogous to the laws of reflection and refraction, are employed to characterize the diffracted rays. A modified form of Fermat's principle, equivalent to these laws, can also be used. Diffracted wave fronts are defined, which can be found by a Huygens wavelet construction. There is an associated phase or eikonal function which satisfies the eikonal equation. In addition complex or imaginary rays are introduced. A field is associated with each ray and the total field at a point is the sum of the fields on all rays through the point. The phase of the field on a ray is proportional to the optical length of the ray from some reference point. The amplitude varies in accordance with the principle of conservation of energy in a narrow tube of rays. The initial value of the field on a diffracted ray is determined from the incident field with the aid of an appropriate diffraction coefficient. These diffraction coefficients are determined from certain canonical problems. They all vanish as the wavelength tends to zero. The theory is applied to diffraction by an aperture in a thin screen diffraction by a disk, etc., to illustrate it. Agreement is shown between the predictions of the theory and various other theoretical analyses of some of these problems. Experimental confirmation of the theory is also presented. The mathematical justification of the theory on the basis of electromagnetic theory is described. Finally, the applicability of this theory, or a modification of it, to other branches of physics is explained.},

  Abstract                 = {Geosat altimeter height measurements for the Gulf Stream for three subtracks from the Exact Repeat Mission were processed to remove the geoid and mean Gulf Stream height. A Gaussian model for the Gulf Stream velocity profile was used to predict the form of the residual height profiles seen by Geosat and the mean height profile, using estimates of the width and position derived from the height residuals. Estimates of the maximum surface velocity and the surface transport were obtained by a least squares fit of the synthetic height profiles to the data. Location statistics from the Geosat data were in good agreement with values obtained from infrared images of the Gulf Stream. Maximum surface velocities were typically between 1.2 and 2.0 m sâ1. The time series showed that surface transport is correlated primarily with the magnitude of the surface velocities, although an anomalously large increase in surface transport in the winter of 1987â1988 was caused by an increase in the width of the Gulf Stream. An analysis of the average annual signal in transport showed maximum values in the late fall and minimum transport in the late spring. Maximum (minimum) surface transport generally occurred when the Gulf Stream was north (south) of its mean position.},

  Abstract                 = {A quasi-synoptic survey of tidally induced salinity changes off the Georgia coast was performed by using a L band microwave radiometer onboard a NASA aircraft. Salinity maps were obtained for ebb and flood conditions in order to define the salinity distributions near rivers and sounds and major changes that occur from ebb flow to flood flow. The Savannah River plume dominated the salinity regime and extended out from the Savannah River mouth about 12 km during ebb tidal conditions. The plume merged into a band of low salinity water extending along the Georgia-South Carolina coast which was produced by the many river sources of freshwater entering the coastal waters. The changes in salinity observed offshore of the river plume area were consistent with estimates of the changes that would occur over a typical tidal excursion perpendicular to the observed gradient.},

  Abstract                 = {The scattering of waves by random rough surfaces has important applications in the remote sensing of oceans and land. The problem of developing a model for rough surfaces is very difficult since, at best, the scattering coefficient s0 is dependent upon (at least) the radar frequency, geometrical and physical parameters, incident and observation angles, and polarization. The problem of electromagnetic scattering from a randomly rough surface is analysed using the Kirchhoff approximation (stationary phase, scalar approximation), the small-perturbation model and the two-scale models. A first major new consideration in this paper is the polarimetric signature calculations as a function of the transmitter location and receiver location for a bistatic radio-link. We calculate the like- and cross-polarized received power directly using the scattering coefficients, without calculating the Mueller matrix. Next, a study of the regions of validity of the Kirchhoff and small-perturbation rough surface scattering models (in the bistatic case) is presented. Comparisons between the numerical calculations and the models are made for various surface rms heights and correlation lengths both normalized to the incident wavenumber (denoted by s and L, respectively). By using these two parameters to form a two-dimensional space, the approximate regions of validity are then established. The second major new consideration is the development of a theoretical two-scale model describing bistatic reflectivity as well as the numerical results computed for the bistatic radar cross section from rough surfaces especially from the sea and snow-covered surfaces. The results are used to show the Brewster angle effect on near-grazing angle scattering.},

  Abstract                 = {Two distinctly different forms of tropical Pacific Ocean warming are shown to have substantially different impacts on the frequency and tracks of North Atlantic tropical cyclones. The eastern Pacific warming (EPW) is identical to that of the conventional El NiÃ±o, whereas the central Pacific warming (CPW) has maximum temperature anomalies located near the dateline. In contrast to EPW events, CPW episodes are associated with a greater-than-average frequency and increasing landfall potential along the Gulf of Mexico coast and Central America. Differences are shown to be associated with the modulation of vertical wind shear in the main development region forced by differential teleconnection patterns emanating from the Pacific. The CPW is more predictable than the EPW, potentially increasing the predictability of cyclones on seasonal time scales.},

  abstract = {This study demonstrates that the spaceborne Aquarius instrument is able to monitor the sea surface salinity (SSS) variations in the East China Sea (ECS) with the spatial resolution of about 150 km at 7-day interval, where routine observations are difficult. The two geophysical contaminants enter the sidelobes of the Aquarius antenna and bias the coastal SSS low: the emission from the land surface and the radiofrequency interference (RFI). Away from about one Aquarius pixel (150 km) from the coastline, the Aquarius SSS is fairly insensitive (less than about 0.2 psu) to the radiometric details of the method to correct for the land emission. The ascending orbits appear to be affected by unfiltered RFI much less than the descending tracks. The Aquarius SSS along the ascending tracks is low over the ECS by 0.40 to 0.93 psu (with respect to the in situ data during the two separate 7-day periods) and is biased low by 0.41 to 1.07 psu (accuracy, or the time-mean of difference from the regional model along three Aquarius tracks over a 18-month period). The presence of the ascending and descending differences in the Aquarius SSS, and the spatially widespread bias suggest that the bias is attributed to the unfiltered RFI originating from strong point sources (rather than to the land contamination from weak distributed sources, or to other seasonally-varying geophysical contaminants). Despite the bias, the Aquarius data describe well the temporal and spatial variability of the ECS SSS. The temporal trend and magnitude of salinity changes agree remarkably between Aquarius and a regional numerical model, during both the freshwater discharge season from the Yangtze river and the rest of the year. The precision of the Aquarius observation in the ECS is comparable with the Aquarius mission requirement (0.2 psu one-sigma for a monthly average over the open ocean). The river discharge rate correlates with the Aquarius SSS with the coefficient of 0.71 on a seasonal scale with the discharge leading the SSS changes. The Aquarius SSS increases away from the coast, in response to the river outflow. The interannual changes in the Aquarius SSS capture the effect of the regional drought in summer 2013.},

  Abstract                 = {Retrieval of the brightness temperature (TB) at the L-band is studied in the context of the remote sensing of ocean surface salinity. The measurement of antenna temperature and the retrieval of TB are simulated with a radiative transfer model and an observing system model of an orbiting spacecraft. Two sets of antenna gain patterns are used: 1) theoretical analysis and 2) measurements of a 1/10th-size scale model. The latter set notably shows the large cross-polarization coupling from the first Stokes transmit into the third Stokes receive. The large cross-polarization coupling causes an error of up to 4 #x00B0; in the estimate of the Faraday rotation angle (the size of the angle itself is mostly less than 15 #x00B0; in the severe ionospheric condition). By this amount of the error, an additional rotation is introduced to the retrieval of the second and third Stokes TBs in front of the feed horn before the Faraday rotation correction. The additional rotation also degrades the performance of the antenna pattern correction (APC). However, when the Faraday rotation correction is performed by the square sum of the two retrieved Stokes, the retrieved TB below the ionosphere and at the top of the atmosphere after the Faraday correction becomes insensitive to the additional rotation (i.e., being insensitive to the error in the Faraday angle estimate and the rotational error in the APC). The formal proof of the insensitivity is presented. The first and second Stokes TBs at the top of the atmosphere observed at 5.6-s intervals from space may be retrieved with an error smaller than 0.1-K rms without the accurate ancillary information of the gain pattern and the Faraday rotation angle, assuming correct calibration, 0.08 K NE #x0394;T for the radiometer noise, and accurate correction or flagging of the solar and galaxy radiation.},

  Abstract                 = {A surface Quasi-Geostrophy based (eSQG) method to diagnose the vertical velocity field from Sea Surface Height (SSH) is assessed using high resolution simulations. These simulations concern a turbulent eddy field with large Rossby numbers and energetic wind-driven motions. Results indicate that low-frequency vertical velocities (and also horizontal motions) can be reconstructed within a range of scales between 20 km and 400 km from the surface down to 500 m. The only information needed is a single high-resolution SSH snapshot and information on the large-scale vertical stratification. Inertial motions are naturally filtered because they do not contaminate SSH as we demonstrate. These results are encouraging and further strengthen previous studies using the eSQG method. They indicate that access to high resolution SSH may represent a major advance to retrieve horizontal and vertical fluxes of any tracer in the upper ocean.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the energy transfer equation for well-developed ocean waves under the influence of wind, and study the conditions for the existence of an equilibrium solution in which wind input, wave-wave interaction and dissipation balance each other. For the wind input we take the parameterization proposed by Snyder and others, which was based on their measurements in the Bight of Abaco and which agrees with Miles's theory. The wave-wave interaction is computed with an algorithm given recently by S. Hasselmann and others. The dissipation is less well-known, but we will make the general assumption that it is quasi-linear in the wave spectrum with a factor coefficient depending only on frequency and integral spectral parameters. In the first part of this paper we investigate whether the assumption that the equilibrium spectrum exits and is given by the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum with a standard type of angular distribution leads to a reasonable dissipation function. We find that this is not the case. Even if one balances the total rate of change for each frequency (which is possible), a strong angular imbalance remains. Thus the assumed source terms are not consistent with this type of asymptotic spectrum. In the second part of the paper we choose a different approach. We assume that the dissipation is given and perform numerical experiments simulating fetch-limited growth, to see under which conditions a stationary solution can be reached. For the dissipation we take K. Haseelmann's form with two unknown parameters. From our analysis it follows that for a certain range of values of these parameters, a quasi-equilibrium solution results. We estimate the relation between dissipation parameters and asymptotic growth rates. For equilibrium spectra, the input, dissipation and nonlinear-transfer source functions are all significant in the energy-containing range of the spectrum. The energy balance proposed by Zakharov and Filonenko in 1966 and Kitaigorodskii in 1983, in which dissipation is assumed to be significant only at high frequencies, yields a spectrum that grows too rapidly and does not approach equilibrium. One of our equilibrium solutions has a one-dimensional spectrum that lies close to the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. However, the angular distribution differs in some important features from standard spreading functions. The energy balance of this equilibrium spectrum is analysed in detail.},

  abstract = {Recent works show that multichannel seismic (MCS) systems are able to provide detailed information on the oceans' fine structure. The aim of this paper is to analyze whether 1-D full waveform inversion algorithms are suitable to recover the extremely weak acoustic impedance contrasts associated to the oceans' fine structure, as well as their potential to image meso-scale objects such as meddies. We limited our analysis to synthetic, noise-free data, in order to identify some methodological issues related to this approach under idealistic conditions (e.g., 1-D wave propagation, noise-free data, known source wavelet). We first discuss the influence of the starting model in the context of the multi-scale strategy that we have implemented. Then we show that it is possible to retrieve not only sound speed but also salinity and temperature contrasts within reasonable bounds from the seismic data using Neural Network relationships trained with regional oceanographic data sets. Potentially, the vertical resolution of the obtained models, which depends on the maximum frequency inverted, is of the order of 5-10 m, whereas the root mean square error of the inverted properties is shown to be 0.5 m/s for sound speed, 0.1\B0C for temperature, and 0.06 for salinity. To conclude this study, we have inverted synthetic data simulated along an oceanographic transect acquired during the EU-funded Geophysical Oceanography (GO) project. The results demonstrate the applicability of the method for synthetic data, as well as its potential to define oceanographic features along 2-D transects at full ocean depth with excellent lateral resolution.},

  abstract = {The survey is devoted to the asymptotic theory of electro-magnetic waves in dispersive media with variable parameters. General questions of the space-time geometric-optics method are considered in Section I. The peculiarities of the material equations for weakly nonstationary dispersive media are discussed in Section II. Numerous physical problems which admit analytical solutions by the geometrical-optics method are considered in Section III (modulated-wave propagation in nondispersive media) and in Section IV (modulated-wave propagation in dispersive media); here, we describe short wavetrain propagation, wave phenomena in media with traveling parameters, compression of frequency-modulated pulses, and other problems. In Section V, the refraction and polarization phenomena arising in nonuniformly moving media are studied. Section VI deals with some problems lying beyond the frames of the geometrical optics (the behavior of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of space-time caustics, quasi-optical description of wave packet propagation). Finally, in Section VII, some new statistical phenomena are investigated for waves propagating in nonstationary random media.},

  Abstract                 = {It is demonstrated that the nonâlinear transform from the ocean wave spectrum to the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image spectrum may be extended to include point target spreading (dispersive) effects. For practical purposes, the extension amounts to an additional azimuth spectral cutâoff factor applied to the result of the velocity bunching nonlinear transform without pointâtarget dispersion. The validity of a quasiâlinear approximation is analysed by means of simple Gaussian test spectra, which also reveal the nature of the fully nonâlinear velocity bunching transform. The inversion problem is formulated as a constrained functional minimization over nonânegative wave spectra. An iterative solution method that requires an a priori estimate of the wave spectrum is demonstrated. Analysis of the method leads to a simple theory for preparing the necessary weight functions for the observed SAR and the a priori wave spectra. Combined with an optimized quasiâlinear oceanâSAR transform, the new formulation leads to a very simple and efficient SAR inversion. RÃ©sumÃ© On dÃ©montre que le transformÃ© non linÃ©aire d'un spectre des vagues de l'ocÃ©an Ã  celui d'un spectre de l'image du radar Ã  ouverture synthÃ©tique (SAR) peut Ãªtre Ã©tendu pour inclure des effets de dispersion de la cible ponctuelle. En pratique, l'Ã©tendue correspond Ã  un facteur de coupure du spectre d'azimut supplÃ©mentaire appliquÃ© au rÃ©sultat du transformÃ© non linÃ©aire du groupement de la vÃ©locitÃ©, sans dispersion de la cible ponctuelle. On analyse la validitÃ© de l'approximation quasiâlinÃ©aire Ã  l'aide de simples spectres du test gaussien qui relÃ¨ve aussi la nature du transformÃ© complet du groupement de la vÃ©locitÃ© non linÃ©aire. Le problÃ¨me d'inversion se formule comme une minimisation fonctionnelle contrainte en fonction des spectres de vagues non nÃ©gatifs. On dÃ©montre une mÃ©thode de solution itÃ©rative qui exige une estimation a priori du spectre des vagues. L'analyse de la mÃ©thode conduit Ã  une simple thÃ©orie sur l'Ã©laboration des fonctions de pondÃ©ration nÃ©cessaires pour les valeurs du SAR observÃ©es et pour les spectres des vagues a priori. La nouvelle formulation, combinÃ©e Ã  un transformÃ© ocÃ©anâSAR quasiâlinÃ©aire optimisÃ© conduit Ã  une inversion du SAR trÃ¨s simple et efficace.},

As demonstrated, these field quantities provide means to distinguish Bragg scattering mechanism and radar returns from breaking waves.

  Abstract                 = {An approach that allows assessment ofthe impact of air-flow separation (AFS) fromwave breaking fronts on the sea-surface drag is presented. Wave breaking fronts are modelled by the discontinuities of the sea-surface slope. It is assumedthat the dynamics of the AFS from wave breaking crests is similar to thatfrom the backward facing step. The form drag supported by an individualbreaker is described by the action of the pressure drop distributed alongthe forward face of the breaking front. The total stress due to the AFS isobtained as a sum of contributions from breaking fronts of different scales.Outside the breaking fronts the drag of the sea surface is supported by theviscous surface stress and the wave-induced stress. To calculate the stressdue to the AFS and the wave-induced stress a physical model of the wind-wavespectrum is used. Together with the model of the air flow described in termsof surface stresses it forms a self-consistent dynamical system for the seasurface-atmosphere where the air flow and wind waves are strongly coupled.Model calculations of the drag coefficient agree with measurements. It is shownthat the dimensionless Charnock parameter (roughness length normalized onthe square of the friction velocity and the acceleration of gravity)increases with the increase of the wind speed in agreement with fieldmeasurements. The stress due to the AFS normalized on the square of thefriction velocity is proportional to the cube of wind speed. At low windsthe viscous surface stress dominates the drag. The role of the form drag,which is the sum of the stress due to the AFS and the wave-induced stress, isnegligible. At moderate and high winds the form drag dominates. At windspeeds higher than 10 m s-1 the stress supported by the AFS becomescomparable to the wave-induced stress and supports up to 50% of the totalstress.},

The variation of the SW spectrum is caused bythe LW orbital velocities and by the variation of the wind stress along thesurface of a LW. The latter is due to the distortion of the flow by a LW, andto the variation of the roughness induced by the modulated short waves. Thisintroduces a feedback mechanism: more SWs give rise to a larger roughness,which by increasing the local stress stimulates the growth of more SWs. It isshown that this aerodynamic feedback effect dominates the modulation of theSW spectrum for moderate and strong winds. The feedback mechanism is mosteffective for SWs in the gravity-capillary range, increasing its dominancewith increasing windspeed and decreasing frequency of a LW. The maximum ofthe SW amplitude modulation is situated at the crest of a LW. The results arein agreement with laboratory and field measurements of the short-wavemodulation.},

  Abstract                 = {It is now well known that parallel cloud bands are widespread in the earth's atmosphere. Observations from manned and unmanned spacecraft and from high-altitude aircraft in connection with soundings from ships and ground stations have shed light on their origin. These and a special investigation of tropical cloudstreets during the BOMEX Project suggest the following typical characteristics of convective cloudstreets: Length = 20 to 500 km; spacing = 2 to 8 km; layer height = 0.8 to 2 km; width-to-height ratio = 2 to 4; wind structure: little change of direction with height; vertical gradient of wind shear (profile curvature) = 10â7 to 10â6 cm-1 sec-1; alignment: along the mean wind of the convective layer. On the theoretical side, linear wind shear is known to favor convective âstreetingâ. The present theory investigates the effect of the observed profile curvature neglecting linear shear effects. It shows that the curvature itself enforces alignment of ccnvective cells with the flow direction. Inertial forces arising from the vorticity field counteract buoyancy forces. Their ratio as expressed in a modified Froude numer determines the value of the critical Rayleigh number responsible for the onset of convection. In a flowing medium this number is raised, often by several orders of magnitude, over that of a resting medium for all convective modes, except the longitudinal mode. Some three-dimensional computer presentations illustrate these results. A quantitative application of the simplified theory to actual atmospheric conditions is attempted. It indieates that in strong flows heated from below longitudinal rolls may double their amplitude in a matter of 10 minutes while transverse rolls decay at a similar rate with symmetric cells having nearly neutral stability. The relations of this concept to other hypotheses and to the Goertler/Taylor rolls are discussed. Finally it is speculated that the formation of wind streaks on water surfaces may be related to a similar mechanism.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the latest improvements applied to the Goddard profiling algorithm (GPROF), particularly as they apply to the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Most of these improvements, however, are conceptual in nature and apply equally to other passive microwave sensors. The improvements were motivated by a notable overestimation of precipitation in the intertropical convergence zone. This problem was traced back to the algorithm's poor separation between convective and stratiform precipitation coupled with a poor separation between stratiform and transition regions in the a priori cloud model database. In addition to now using an improved convective-stratiform classification scheme, the new algorithm also makes use of emission and scattering indices instead of individual brightness temperatures. Brightness temperature indices have the advantage of being monotonic functions of rainfall. This, in turn, has allowed the algorithm to better define the uncertainties needed by the scheme's Bayesian inversion approach. Last, the algorithm over land has been modified primarily to better account for ambiguous classification where the scattering signature of precipitation could be confused with surface signals. All these changes have been implemented for both the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I). Results from both sensors are very similar at the storm scale and for global averages. Surface rainfall products from the algorithm's operational version have been compared with conventional rainfall data over both land and oceans. Over oceans, GPROF results compare well with atoll gauge data. GPROF is biased negatively by 9\% with a correlation of 0.86 for monthly 2.5Â° averages over the atolls. If only grid boxes with two or more atolls are used, the correlation increases to 0.91 but GPROF becomes positively biased by 6\%. Comparisons with TRMM ground validation products from Kwajalein reveal that GPROF is negatively biased by 32\%, with a correlation of 0.95 when coincident images of the TMI and Kwajalein radar are used. The absolute magnitude of rainfall measured from the Kwajalein radar, however, remains uncertain, and GPROF overestimates the rainfall by approximately 18\% when compared with estimates done by a different research group. Over land, GPROF shows a positive bias of 17\% and a correlation of 0.80 over monthly 5Â° grids when compared with the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) gauge network. When compared with the precipitation radar (PR) over land, GPROF also retrieves higher rainfall amounts (20\%). No vertical hydrometeor profile information is available over land. The correlation with the TRMM precipitation radar is 0.92 over monthly 5Â° grids, but GPROF is positively biased by 24\% relative to the radar over oceans. Differences between TMI- and PR-derived vertical hydrometeor profiles below 2 km are consistent with this bias but become more significant with altitude. Above 8 km, the sensors disagree significantly, but the information content is low from both TMI and PR. The consistent bias between these two sensors without clear guidance from the ground-based data reinforces the need for better understanding of the physical assumptions going into these retrievals.},

  Abstract                 = {A method of incorporating ocean surface foam into a combined asymmetric wave geometrical optics (AWGO) ocean surface emission model using dielectric mixing theory is investigated. Dielectric mixing represents a more direct method of denying the emissivity of ocean foam within in the AWGO emission model compared with the current AWGO foam emissivity values which are based upon models derived from airborne brightness temperature measurements of ocean foam. Unfortunately, these observations may not reflect the proper sea state or other relevant conditions that are desired within the model. Using dielectric mixing, knowledge of the void fraction within a foam-covered area is used to compute the emission characteristics of a surface facet. This latter technique perhaps will allow better fidelity in ocean foam emission modeling provided that data concerning the bubble density, bubble size distributions, and foam patch locations are well known. Comparison of AWGO model brightness temperatures using the above two methods of modeling foam emissivity illustrate the sensitivity to foam in the computed azimuthal wind direction signatures},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of upwelling and downwelling rain brightness temperatures show significant differences between horizontal and vertical polarization, which depend on wavelength and rain rate. These measurements are related to the first and second Stokes parameter. Also, the third Stokes parameter of atmospheric microwave emission will have measurable values under certain conditions. A polarimetric model for the description of the microwave emission and scattering by hydrometeors, including all four Stokes parameters, is presented. This model is applied to the scenario of plane layers of ice crystals and rain above a rough surface. The magnitudes of the third Stokes parameter for microwave emission from oriented nonspherical rain drops and for scattering by ice crystals are estimated. It is shown that the third Stokes parameter for rain is dominated by the first azimuthal harmonic of the emission vector. Finally, an algorithm for the computation of polarized brightness temperatures emanating from cylindrical rain cells above a surface is developed.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine a dynamical method for estimating subsurface fields (density, pressure, horizontal and vertical velocities) in the upper ocean using sea-surface temperature (SST) and a climatological estimate of the stratification. The method derives from the #surface##quasi-geostrophic# (SQG) approximation. The SST is used to generate a potential vorticity (PV) field which is then inverted for the pressure. We examine first the standard SQG model, in which the PV is assumed trapped in a delta-function layer at the surface. We then modify the model by introducing a subsurface PV which is proportional to the surface density and decays exponentially with depth. We derive the subsurface density from the hydrostatic relation, the horizontal velocities from geostrophy and the subsurface vertical velocities from the quasi-geostrophic omega equation.<br xmlns=#http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/#></br>We compare the predicted densities and velocities with those from a three-dimensional (3D) ocean model, and from <i xmlns=#http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/#>in situ</i> measurements in the Mediterranean, Eastern Pacific and the Azores Current. In most cases the standard SQG model predicts the qualitative structure of the subsurface flow. But it also underestimates its strength. The modified model yields better estimates of both the strength and vertical structure of the subsurface flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Tropical surface currents are estimated from satellite-derived surface topography and wind stress using a physically based statistical model calibrated by 15 m drogue drifters. The model assumes a surface layer dominated by steady geostrophic and Ekman dynamics. Geostrophy varies smoothly from a Î² plane formulation at the equator to an Æ plane formulation in midlatitude, with the transition occurring at â¼2Â°â3Â° latitude. The transition is treated with a Gaussian weight function having a meridional decay scale that is found to be approximately the Rossby radius (â¼2.2Â° latitude). The two-parameter Ekman model represents drifter motion relative to wind stress, with downwind flow along the equator and turning with latitude. Velocities computed from satellite data are evaluated statistically against drifter velocities and equatorial current moorings. Examples of the geostrophic and Ekman flow fields in the western Pacific during a westerly wind burst in late December 1992 depict a strong eastward flow and equatorial convergence. A comparison between December 1996 and June 1997 illustrates the basin-wide reversal of equatorial surface flow during the onset of the 1997 El NiÃ±o.},

  Abstract                 = {A detailed analysis is made of the observed behaviour in interaction, tropical-cyclone-scale vortices in the western North Pacific region. It is found that all multiple-vortex interactions can be broken down into a common model of binary interaction. The classical Fujiwhara model of converging cyclonic rotation about a centroid followed by merger is rarely followed. Capture tends to occur rapidly, within several hours, and is followed by a period of relatively stable cyclonic orbit. Cyclone merger occurs by one vortex experiencing a loss of convective organization, followed by horizontal shearing and incorporation into the outer circulation of the other vortex. However, a substantial proportion of interacting cyclones escape from the interaction, and the changeover from a stable orbiting configuration occurs rapidly. A model of binary interaction is presented. Cases where swarms of mesoscale vortices are formed in convectively active regions without tropical cyclones are also documented. These vortices have a much narrower range of influence (a few hundred kilometres) then that observed for tropical cyclones. When groups of vortices come within this range they are observed to conform to the same interaction model as observed for tropical cyclones.},

  Abstract                 = {Satellite instruments, that will monitor salinity from space in the near future, require an accurate relationship between salinity/temperature and seawater dielectric constant. This paper will review measurements that were made of the dielectric constant of seawater during the past several years. The objective of the measurements is to determine the dependence of the dielectric constant of seawater on salinity and on temperature, more accurately than in the past. by taking advantage of modem instrumentation. The measurements of seawater permittivity have been performed as a function of salinity and temperature using a transmission resonant cavity technique. The measurements have been made in the salinity range of 10 to 38 psu and in the temperature range of IOU C to 35 C. These results will be useful in algorithm development for sensor systems such as SMOS and Aquarius. The measurement system consists of a brass microwave cavity that is resonant at 1.413 GHz. The seawater is introduced into the cavity through a capillary glass tube having an inner diameter of 0.1 mm. The diameter of the tube has been made very small so that the amount of seawater introduced in the cavity is small - thus maintaining the sensitivity of the measurements and allowing the use of perturbation theory predicting the seawater permittivity. The change in resonant frequency and the change in cavity Q can be used to determine the real and imaginary part of the dielectric constant of seawater introduced into the slender tube. The microwave measurements are made by an HPS722D network analyzer. The cavity has been immersed in a uateriethylene-glycol bath which is connected to a Lauda circulator. The circulator keeps the brass cavity at a temperature constant to within 0.01 degrees. The system is automated using a Visual Basic program to control the analyzer and to collect the data. The results of the dielectric constant measurements of seawater will be presented. The measurement results will be compared with permittivity values generated from the Klein and Swift relationship. Two methods of calibration will be discussed, The errors that each technique introduces into the measurement resulls will be reviewed. Temperature stability, frequency drift and the effect of increasing cavity transmission loss on the unloaded cavity Q will also be discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary form only given. The effect of the capillary-tube exit holes in the microwave resonant cavity used to measure the dielectric constant of seawater at L-band, is investigated. The cavity technique is a perturbation method that uses the change in the resonant frequency and Q of the cavity when seawater is added to determine the complex dielectric constant of seawater. The tube, through which the seawater is introduced into the cavity, enters through two small center holes in the cavity's endplates. It has been suggested in the literature that these small exit holes could affect the change in the resonant frequency measurement, thus introducing a frequency pulling error into the measurements. Numerical modeling of similar cavities indicates that a frequency pulling effect can occur due to the center holes in the endplates. These simulations indicate that a coaxial TEM-like mode is created in the connector that holds the capillary tube to the endplates. This TEM-like mode reflects from the end of the connector and acts as a resonant circuit. Since the seawater is acting as the center conductor of the TEM guide, the effect should be more noticeable as the conductivity of the seawater increases. The conductivity increases with increasingsalinity and temperature. To see whether the frequency-pulling effect is important, a lossy graphite cylinder with a hole in the center has been inserted into the connector, to attenuate the TEM wave. Measurements for high salinity and high temperatures have been made with and without the graphite cylinder. The results of the measurements will be discussed in this study.},

Aquarius will be sensing the sea surface salinity from space in this band. The objective of the project is to refine the model function for the dielectric constant as a function of salinity and temperature so that remote sensing measurements can be made with the accuracy needed to meet the measurement goals (0.2 psu) of the Aquarius mission. The measurements were made, using a microwave cavity operated in the transmission configuration. The cavity's temperature was accurately regulated to 0.02 C by immersing it in a temperature controlled bath of distilled water and ethanol glycol. Seawater had been purchased from Ocean Scientific International Limited (OS1L) at salinities of 30, 35 and 38 psu. Measurements of these seawater samples were then made over a range of temperatures, from l0 C to 35 C in 5 C intervals. Repeated measurements were made at each temperature and salinity, Mean values and standard deviations were then computed. Total error budgets indicated that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant had a relative accuracy of about l%.},

  Abstract                 = {If model parameterizations of unresolved physics, such as the variety of upper ocean mixing processes, are to hold over the large range of time and space scales of importance to climate, they must be strongly physically based. Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed. Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocal âK profile parameterizationâ (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind-driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double-diffusion density ratio, RÏ. Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969â1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.},

  Abstract                 = {We derived the sea level variability in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre between 15$\,^{\circ}$ and 35$\,^{\circ}$S from 2 years of the Geosat exact repeat mission altimeter data. On the mesoscale, along-track wavenumber spectra are those of nonlinear dynamics with a steeper slope and stronger energy along the eastern boundary. Frequency/wavenumber spectra reveal a significant semiannual signal at a wavelength of about 500 km. West of the Walvis ridge (5$\,^{\circ}$E), this signal appears to correspond to semiannual Rossby waves of 2- to 3-cm amplitude, propagating westward at 3 cm sâ1, and showing latitude refraction effects. The pattern is very similar to that of annual Rossby waves as modeled by Reason et al. (1987). These waves are probably related to the semiannual wind component. However, understanding the exact mechanism for their excitation requires dynamical modeling. The large-scale variability also shows a significant semiannual component (about 6-cm amplitude and 15% of the yearly variance) in phase with climatological winds.},

  Abstract                 = {Aquarius was launched on June 10, 2011 aboard the Aquarius/SAC-D observatory and the instrument has been operating continuously since the initial turned-on was completed on August 25. The initial observed antenna temperatures were close to predicted and the first salinity map was released in September. In order to map the ocean salinity field, Aquarius includes several special features such as the inclusion of a scatterometer to provide a roughness correction, measurement of the third Stokes parameter to correct for Faraday rotation, and fast sampling to mitigate the effects of RFI. This paper provides an overview of the instrument and an example of initial results. Details are covered in subsequent papers in the session on Aquarius.},

  abstract = {High-resolution hydrographic measurements collected along the southern edge of Georges Bank during March and June-July 1997 focused on characterizing processes that drive fluxes of material between the slope and bank. Wintertime sampling characterized changes driven by a strong storm. A Scotian Shelf crossover event produced a ribbon of anomalously fresh water along the bank's southern flank that was diluted during the storm. Comparison of prestorm and poststorm sections shows that over the bank changes in heat and salt inventories are consistent with those expected solely from local surface fluxes. In deeper waters, advective effects, likely associated with frontal motion and eddies, are clearly important. Summertime surveys resolve the development of a massive intrusion of Gulf Stream-like waters onto the bank. East of the intrusion, a thin extrusion of bank water is drawn outward by the developing ring, exporting fresher water at a rate of about 7 Ã 104 m3/s. A large-amplitude Gulf Stream meander appears to initiate the extrusion, but it quickly evolves, near the bank edge, into a warm core ring. Ring water intrudes to approximately the 80 m isobath, 40 km inshore from the bank edge. The intrusion process seems analogous to the development of Gulf Stream shingles (a hydrodynamic instability) in the South Atlantic Bight. It appears that, once the intruded water is established on the bank, it remains there and dissipates in place. Although the intrusion is an extremely dramatic event, it is probably not actually a major contributor to shelf edge exchanges over a seasonal time scale.},

  Abstract                 = {The mean dynamic topography of the surface of the ocean is estimated using a finite difference inverse model of the ocean circulation constrained by a prior TOPEX/Poseidon-EGM96 estimate and an ocean density climatology. The EGM96 geoid uncertainties are represented by their full covariance matrix. The model finds a solution that yields a new 1\'e-resolution dynamic topography estimate with a 5 cm precision. The existence of this solution suggests that the uncertainties in EGM96, despite being much smaller than in previous geopotential models, are nonetheless realistic. The geodetic information constrains the inverse estimate of the ocean circulation, particularly at high latitudes.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a comparison between two models for rough surface scattering computations: the boundary perturbation method (BPM) and the integral equation method (IEM). They differ in two fundamental aspects: the method used to compute the electric and magnetic fields on the surface and the surface information required for the computation. The two approaches lead analytically to the same solution in the two asymptotic cases of very large and very small vertical displacements, with no intermediate scales. For a composite surface the solution of the BPM is expressed as the sum of two terms, while a series development up to higher orders can be formulated with the IEM. In this paper, the comparison is restricted to composite surfaces and, particularly, to the ocean surface. After presenting a method for the two-scale decomposition of a rough surface, which satisfies the constraints of the electromagnetic model for each scale, we compute the scattering by the ocean surface using both models for various instrumental configurations and surface conditions. We show that considering the accuracy of usual radar measurements and under the assumptions made for the development of the models, both methods give very similar results. Since the BPM is based on a simple physical argument and appears to be more efficient than the two-scale IEM with regard to the computation time, the BPM should be preferred for ocean-like rough surfaces.},

In this work, we use the triple collocation method with SMOS, AMSR-E (LPRM) and ASCAT soil moisture products at a global scale. The goal of this study is to compare SMOS soil moisture product to already existing data sets, to evaluate its accuracy and to identify the kind of areas where SMOS performs better (type of vegetation or soil).},

  abstract = {Seasonal SeaWiFS chlorophyll a concentrations cycles and annual changes of altimeter Sea Level Anomaly are derived for the subtropical North Atlantic near â¼ 35Â°N and along a Gulf Stream axis. Spatial structure of SeaWiFS, is defined in terms of deviations from a local seasonal cycle and examined in relation to altimeter eddy structure. In the subtropical region near 35Â°N, SeaWiFS structure is evident during the spring bloom period with a scale of â¼ 430 km, or about twice the eddy scale. A Gulf Stream axis has been selected as a region where the Sea Level Anomaly variance is a maximum. Eddy propagation speeds and scales are examined. Cold-core (cyclonic) rings correspond to areas of high SeaWiFS chlorophyll a. Warm-core (anticyclonic) rings relate to areas of low chlorophyll concentration. Both SeaWiFS structure and eddy structure have a spatial scale of â¼ 450 km or twice the ring scale along the Gulf Stream axis. SeaWiFS chlorophyll anomalies and Altimeter Sea Level Anomaly structure have an overall negative correlation coefficient of r&} # xa0;=& #{xa0;â&#xa0;0.34. Swirl currents between eddies redistribute surface chlorophyll concentrations and can spatially bias maximum and minimum concentration levels off eddy centre.},

  Abstract                 = {Mean square slope (MSS) of sea surface is a parameter describing the sea surface roughness and plays a key role in understanding the sea surface dynamics. Although MSS is influenced by many factors such as wind speed and sea surface waves, it has been traditionally parameterized by wind speed only. In this study, the surface wave impact on MSS is investigated using a collocated data set of altimeter and buoy measurements. It is found that the MSS detected by Ku-band altimeter is closely related to the wind wave components and increases with the degree of wind wave development; however, it is almost independent of the swell. The wave effect on MSS is mainly ascribed to the contribution of longer waves rather than shorter waves. An analytical spectral MSS model is proposed, and it is shown that the MSS calculated from the model agrees well with the altimeter-measured MSS when the pseudo-wave age is adjusted to the wave age corresponding to wind waves. This model is applied to derive wind speeds from altimeter data including the normalized radar cross section and the significant wave height of sea surface waves. With the collocated data set, it is shown that this new algorithm performs better than previous empirical algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {A practical atmospheric Millimeter-Wave Propagation Model (MPM) is formulated that predicts attenuation, delay, and noise properties of moist air for frequencies up to 1000 GHz. Input variables are height distributions (0â30 km) of pressure, temperature, humidity, and suspended droplet concentration along an anticipated radio path. Spectroscopic data consist of more than 450 parameters describing local O2 and H2O absorption lines complemented by continuum spectra for dry air, water vapor, and hydrosols. For a model (MPM*) limited to frequencies below 300 GHz, the number of spectroscopic parameters can be reduced to less than 200. Recent laboratory measurements by us at 138 GHz of absolute attenuation rates for simulated air with water vapor pressures up to saturation allow the formulation of an improved, though empirical water vapor continuum. Model predictions are compared with selected (2.5â430 GHz) data from both laboratory and field experiments. In general, good agreement is obtained.},

  abstract = {This paper examines microwave measurement polarization for mesospheric temperature profile retrieval on a global basis, for which forthcoming satellite instruments are tasked. Retrieval performances at circular, horizontal, and vertical polarization are mapped across the range of geomagnetic conditions (field strength and view orientation) and are related to the impact of Zeeman line splitting on temperature channel weighting functions. Retrieval performance is hampered by conditions that cause clusters and gaps with respect to the heights at which the weighting functions peak, and this may be a greater detriment to sounding performance than the double-peaking of weighting functions that has been previously identified as a pitfall of sounding in linear polarization. Each of the measurement polarizations was better than the other two under some of the geomagnetic conditions. An orbit simulator was used to document the frequency of occurrence of each of the geomagnetic viewing conditions. With respect to overall global performance, circular polarization was found to be the best choice, regardless whether conical or cross-track scanning is used. Between the linear polarizations, vertical was preferable to horizontal for conical sounding at fine spectral resolution.},

  abstract = {Satellite measurements from microwave instruments have made a significant contribution to the skill of numerical weather forecasting, on both global and regional scales. A FAST microwave Emissivity Model (FASTEM), which was developed by the Met Office, U.K., has been widely utilized to compute the surface emitted radiation in forward calculations. However, the FASTEM model was developed for frequencies in the range of 20-60 GHz, and it is biased at higher and lower frequencies. Several critical components such as variable sea surface salinity and full Stokes vector have not been generally taken into account. In this paper, the effects of the permittivity models are investigated, and a new permittivity model is generated by using the measurements for fresh and salt water at frequencies between 1.4 and 410 GHz. A modified sea surface roughness model from Durden and Vesecky is applied to the detailed two-scale surface emissivity calculations. This ocean emissivity model at microwave is now being used in the Community Radiative Transfer Model, and it has resulted in some major improvements in microwave radiance simulations. This paper is a joint effort of the Met Office, U.K., and the Joint Center for the Satellite Data Assimilation, U.S. The model is called as FASTEM-4 in the Radiative Transfer for TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder model.},

The results may be stated with special simplicity for a 'ring' spectrum when the energy in the spectrum is confined to one particular wavelength $\overline{\lambda}$ . In particular, the average density of maxima per unit area equals $\pi /(2\surd 3\overline{\lambda}{}^{2})$ , and the average length, per unit area, of the contour drawn at the mean level equals $\pi /(\surd 2\overline{\lambda})$ .},

  Abstract                 = {A delay/Doppler-mapping receiver system, developed specifically for global positioning system (GPS)-reflection remote sensing, is described, and example delay/Doppler waveforms are presented. The high-quality data obtained with this system provide a more accurate and detailed examination of ground-based and aircraft GPS-reflection phenomenology than has been available to date. As an example, systematic effects in the reflected signal delay waveform, due to nonideal behavior of the C/A-code auto-correlation function, are presented for the first time. Both a single-channel open-loop recording system and a recently developed 16-channel recorder are presented. The open-loop data from either recorder are postprocessed with a software GPS receiver that performs the following functions: signal detection; phase and delay tracking; delay, Doppler, and delay/Doppler waveform mapping; dual-frequency (L1 and L2) processing; C/A-code and Y-code waveform extraction; coherent integrations as short as 125 Î¼s; navigation message decoding; and precise observable time tagging. The software can perform these functions on all detectable satellite signals without dead time, and custom signal-processing features can easily be included into the system},

  Abstract                 = {Because the tropical Atlantic is characterized by regions of strong seasonal variability that have been sampled inhomogeneously by surface drifters, Eulerian averages of these Lagrangian observations in spatially fixed bins may be aliased. In the Pacific, this problem has been circumvented by first calculating seasonal or monthly means. In the Atlantic, such an approach is of limited value because of the relatively sparse database of drifter observations. As an alternative, a methodology is developed in which drifter-observed currents and sea surface temperatures are grouped into bins and, within each bin, simultaneously decomposed into a time-mean, annual and semiannual harmonics, and an eddy residual with a nonzero integral time scale. The methodology is evaluated using a temporally homogeneous SST product and in situ SST observations, and also using simulated drifter observations in an eddy-resolving model of the Atlantic Ocean. These analyses show that, compared to simple bin averaging, the decomposition developed herein yields significantly improved estimates of time-mean values in regions of strong seasonal variability. The methodology can also successfully estimate the distribution of the seasonal harmonicsâ amplitude and phase throughout much of the tropical Atlantic.},

  Abstract                 = {A combination of surface drifters and altimetry is used to analyze the seasonal to interannual variability of the surface velocity field in the Brazil-Malvinas confluence of the western South Atlantic Ocean. Longer-term changes are inferred from wind and sea surface temperature fields. During the period October 1992 to December 2007, a southward shift of â0.6 to â0.9Â° decadeâ1 is found in the confluence latitude of the Brazil and Malvinas currents. A comparable trend is found in the latitude of the maximum wind stress curl averaged across the South Atlantic basin, allowing a proxy for the confluence latitude to be calculated for the prealtimeter time period. This longer time series suggests that the recent trend may be part of a longer-term oscillation, which has returned to values last sustained in the early 1980s. This variation does not appear to be related to the multidecadal trend in the Southern Annular Mode, but instead is inversely related to long-term variations in the sea surface temperature anomaly in the Agulhas-Benguela pathway of the eastern South Atlantic subtropical basin.},

  Abstract                 = {Global near-surface currents are calculated from satellite-tracked drogued drifter velocities on a 0.5Â° Ã 0.5Â° latitude-longitude grid using a new methodology. Data used at each grid point lie within a centered bin of set area with a shape defined by the variance ellipse of current fluctuations within that bin. The time-mean current, its annual harmonic, semiannual harmonic, correlation with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), spatial gradients, and residuals are estimated along with formal error bars for each component. The time-mean field resolves the major surface current systems of the world. The magnitude of the variance reveals enhanced eddy kinetic energy in the western boundary current systems, in equatorial regions, and along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, as well as three large âeddy deserts,â two in the Pacific and one in the Atlantic. The SOI component is largest in the western and central tropical Pacific, but can also be seen in the Indian Ocean. Seasonal variations reveal details such as the gyre-scale shifts in the convergence centers of the subtropical gyres, and the seasonal evolution of tropical currents and eddies in the western tropical Pacific Ocean. The results of this study are available as a monthly climatology.},

  Abstract                 = {{T}he space-borne measurements of the {SMOS} mission reveal for the first time the complete features of the sea surface salinity ({SSS}) signature at the full scale of the {P}acific basin. {T}he {SSS} field in the equatorial cold tongue is typically found to be larger than 35.1 within a narrow 2Â° band of latitude that is positioned slightly south of the equator and that stretches across the eastern {P}acific basin up to the {G}alapagos {I}slands. {O}n the northern edge of the eastern equatorial {P}acific this signature results in a very strong horizontal gradient (larger than 2 units over 100 km) with the fresh waters of the {P}anama warm pool. {B}y considering a water density criterion, it can be shown that the cold tongue is characterized by a strong seasonal cycle with a 3Â°{C} amplitude in {SST} where the warm season of {F}ebruary-{M}arch contrasts with the cold period extending from {S}eptember to {N}ovember. {I}f the present ocean reanalyzes are able to capture these features, then the assimilation of the {SMOS} data becomes a worthwhile objective in order to depict more accurately the salinity signature of the cold tongue of the tropical {P}acific.},

The equation can be considered as a modification of the Charnock formula. The data are also compared with the parameterizations of Toba and Koga, and of Hsu, and the consequences of the new equation for aerodynamic drag are discussed. In the new equation, the drag coefficient is expressed as a function of both wind speed and wave age c p/u*. This testifies to the strong wave-age dependence of the drag, found in several experimental studies. It is also in good agreement with results of a theoretical model of the airflow-seawave interaction, proposed by Janssen (1989).},

Here we present a dynamically and kinematically consistent estimate of the magnitude and structure of global ocean circulation and its associated heat fluxes, derived by integrating hydrographic velocity data over the rapid spatial variations that they show. We find no single overturning cell, but instead a complex and probably time-varying circulation pattern. The simplest interpretation suggests that there are two nearly independent cells: one connecting overturning in the Atlantic Ocean to other basins through the Southern Ocean, and the other connecting the Indian and Pacific basins through the Indonesian archipelago.},

It is found that the spiral rain bands exhibit many characteristics similar to those found in the troughs in the âRossby Wavesâ of the general circulation. In addition to many qualitative analogies, the spiral bands are regions where a substantial amount of potential energy is converted to kinetic. Although there are no direct measurements to show that the spiral rain bands mark the presence of a Rossby-like wave structure, observations of the momentum budget suggest that there is an eddy flux of momentum into hurricanes in the same sense as that observed in the general circulation.},

  Abstract                 = {A semi-analytical method is presented for constructing a global orthogonal curvilinear ocean mesh which has no singularity point inside the computational domain since the mesh poles are moved to land points. The method involves defining an analytical set of mesh parallels in the stereographic polar plan, computing the associated set of mesh meridians, and projecting the resulting mesh onto the sphere. The set of mesh parallels proposed here is defined as a series of embedded circles. The resulting mesh presents no loss of continuity in either the mesh lines or the scale factors over the whole ocean domain, as the mesh is not a composite mesh. Thus, the Bering Strait can be opened without specific treatment. The equator is a mesh line, which provides a better numerical solution for equatorial dynamics. The resolution can be easily controlled through the definition of three analytical functions which can increase resolution and/or maintain a low ratio of anisotropy. The mesh has been implemented in the LODYC general circulation ocean model. Results of a semi-diagnostic simulation are shown.},

  Abstract                 = {The observations collected during a series of three oceanographic cruises dedicated to the study of the frontal zone at the eastern edge of the equatorial Pacific warm pool are used to study the role of salinity in the static stratification of the ocean upper layers. By combining physical and biogeochemical data, the position of the frontal zone at the surface could be accurately determined between 157.5\'eE and 173.4\'eE. A multiparameter approach is required due to the uncertainty that may result when one parameter is only considered. In the subsurface the thermohaline structures around the frontal zone reveal the predominant role of the ocean salinity stratification within the isothermal layers. However, the actual methods to determine the salinity barrier layer thickness cannot separate in detail the different dynamical regimes near the frontal zone and another variable to identify the role of the salinity in the static vertical stratification is then proposed and tested on several data sets. This method takes into account the thermal and the saline dependencies in the Brunt-V\'eis\'el\'e frequency in order to isolate the specific role of the salinity stratification in the layers above the main thermocline. The results show that the equatorial western Pacific is characterized by an increasing east-west gradient in salinity stratification whereas the stronger values are found westward of the eastern edge of the warm pool. This diagnostic then provides the basis for an examination of the dynamical mechanisms involved in the formation of the salinity stratification. It also confirms the importance of the ocean salinity in the variability of the equatorial Pacific warm pool. The potentially important implications for the El Ni\'eo-Southern Oscillation variability are discussed.},

All these processes lead to signals in sea level which range between 2 and 10 cm. An important result is that in the western tropical Pacific Ocean the effect of salinity variability on sea level may be equal to the effect of thermal variability.},

  abstract = {Recent theory suggests that ocean-atmosphere interactions in the western Pacific warm pool are of fundamental importance to interannual variations associated with El NiÃ±o and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The warm pool encompasses the highest mean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the world ocean, intense atmospheric deep convection and heavy rainfall, and the formation of thick salt-stratified barrier layers that help to sustain the high SSTs. This study shows that the eastern edge of the warm pool is characterized by a strong zonal salinity front throughout 2002--2004. The analysis also indicates a tighter empirical relationship than previously observed between the eastern edge of the warm pool, high SSTs, the presence of barrier layers, and the fetch of westerly wind bursts. These results suggest that such a frontal region is a critical in controlling ocean-atmosphere interactions in the western Pacific warm pool and highlight the importance of the upper ocean salinity in climate variability.},

  abstract = {The small-scale features in sea surface temperature and salinity fields (SST and SSS) of the Coral Sea are examined using high horizontal spatial and short-term temporal in situ measurements. These features are extracted from thermosalinographs (TSGs) gathered onboard commercial and research vessels and at one long-term fixed station. The analyses are performed along the vessel tracks and the structures of small-scale features are extracted by high-pass spatial filtering the original TSG data. For SSS, it is shown that the features at the scale of mesoscale eddies (â¼100 km) vary from about â1.1 to +0.6 psu in the Coral Sea region. Processes sustaining such range include rainfall events, stirring by mesoscale eddies, and the latitudinal displacement of the sharp front associated with the edge of the Western Pacific Warm Pool at the seasonal time scales. The TSG data have revealed the presence of a sharp front (0.4-0.6 psu) between the subtropical and equatorial waters instead of a smooth gradient in the standard SSS climatologies. Within the context of recent remotely sensed observations of salinity, this could represent an important limitation for the validation and calibration of satellite products. In addition to these spatial considerations, temporal variations at one long-term station near Vanuatu show that the coupled air-sea responses to intraseasonal tropical variability, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, may have a signature in both SST and SSS fields. However, this response is found to be complex and not necessarily in phase. In the Coral Sea region, our results suggest that MJO-induced variability on SST and SSS exhibit little coherency at the seasonal time scales.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of the barrier layer during the onset of El Ni\'eo is investigated using a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model. Sensitivity experiments are done by removing or keeping the salinity stratification in the upper layer of the western equatorial Pacific warm pool. The barrier layer favors the maintenance and displacement of the warm pool into the central Pacific by isolating the mixed layer from the entrainment cooling at depth and by confining the response of westerly wind events (WWEs) to a shallow mixed layer. The increased zonal fetch of WWEs through the coupling with sea surface temperature (SST) enhances downwelling equatorial Kelvin waves and thus leads to El Ni\'eo. In the absence of salinity stratification, slightly cooler SST and a reduced eastward displacement of the warm pool result in a reduced El Ni\'eo or a return to the mean seasonal cycle of the model. The possibility that the barrier layer affects the onset of El Ni\'eo pleads for a careful consideration of the salinity stratification in climate forecasts.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of sea waves on sensible heat and momentum fluxes is described. The approach is based on the conservation of heat and momentum in the marine atmospheric surface layer. The experimental fact that the drag coefficient above the sea increases considerably with increasing wind speed, while the exchange coefficient for sensible heat (Stanton number) remains virtually independent of wind speed, is explained by a different balance of the turbulent and the wave-induced parts in the total fluxes of momentum and sensible heat. Organised motions induced by waves support the wave-induced stress which dominates the surface momentum flux. These organised motions do not contribute to the vertical flux of heat. The heat flux above waves is determined, in part, by the influence of waves upon the turbulence diffusivity. The turbulence diffusivity is altered by waves in an indirect way. The wave-induced stress dominates the surface flux and decays rapidly with height. Therefore the turbulent stress above waves is no longer constant with height. That changes the balance of the turbulent kinetic energy and of the dissipation rate and, hence the diffusivity. The dependence of the exchange coefficient for heat on wind speed is usually parameterized in terms of a constant Stanton number. However, an increase of the exchange coefficient with wind speed is not ruled out by field measurements and could be parametrized in terms of a constant temperature roughness length. Because of the large scatter, field data do not allow us to establish the actual dependence. The exchange coefficient for sensible heat, calculated from the model, is virtually independent of wind speed in the range of 3â10 ms-1. For wind speeds above 10 ms-1 an increase of 10% is obtained, which is smaller than that following from the âconstant roughness lengthâ parameterization.},

Important in this analysis is the concept of the generalized radiance function, introduced by Walther in 1968. The concepts of generalized radiant emittance and of generalized radiant intensity are introduced and it is shown how all these quantities may be expressed in terms of coherence functions of the source. Both the generalized radiance of Walther and the generalized radiant emittance may take on negative values, indicating that these quantities have, in general, a less-direct physical meaning than have the corresponding quantities of traditional radiometry (which presumably represents the incoherent limit of the present theory). The generalized radiant intensity is, however, always found to be non-negative and, just as in the incoherent limit, represents the angular distribution of the energy flux in the far zone.},

This function characterizes the correlation that exists between the complex amplitudes of any two plane waves in the angular spectrum description of the statistical ensemble that represents the field. Relations between this function and the more commonly known correlation functions are derived. In particular, it is shown that the angular correlation function is essentially the four-dimensional spatial Fourier transform of the cross-spectral density function of the source. The angular correlation function is shown to characterize completely the second-order coherence properties of the far field. An expression for the intensity distribution in the far zone of a field generated by a source of any state of coherence is deduced. Some generalizations of the far-zone form of the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem are also obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {Maggi and Rubinowicz formulated a boundary wave theory of diffraction at an aperture, which may be regarded as developments of early ideas of Young about the nature of diffraction. These investigations were based on the Kirchhoff diffraction theory. In the present paper it is shown that a theory of the boundary diffraction wave may also be formulated by taking as starting point the representation of the field in terms of the Rayleigh diffraction integrals, which are free from a mathematical inconsistency inherent in the Kirchhoff theory. It is shown that the Rayleigh integrals (with physically approximate but mathematically consistent boundary conditions of the Kirchhoff type) may be transformed into the sum of two terms. One term represents the effect of a disturbance which originates in each point of the boundary of the aperture (boundary wave); the other represents the combined effect of disturbances originating in certain special points situated within the aperture. In the special cases when the field incident upon the aperture is plane or spherical, the second term represents precisely the disturbances predicted by geometrical optics, in strict analogy with the classical results of Maggi and Rubinowicz. In these special cases the boundary wave of the present theory differs from the boundary wave of the earlier theories only in the form of an inclination factor.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a generalized approach for the objective analysis of nonstationary, heterogeneous fields. An algorithm is presented that uses an anisotropic, time-dependent correlation function with correlation parameters that vary in space/time and a time-dependent trend surface for efficient objective analysis of dynamically heterogeneous and nonstationary fields. The algorithm, which we term the âparameter matrix algorithmâ, is applied to two data sets. The first is tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) derived from satellite AVHRR data and Pan-Toga drifting buoys. The SST appliclication illustrates how the parameter matrix is used for the computationally efficient objective analysis of the tropical Pacific SST from 30Â°S to 30Â°N at 0.2Â° resolution (over 290,000 grid points) using approximately 350,000 data points from 12 2-day satellite SST composites. The second example uses data from the Anatomy of a Meander/ BIOSYNOP experiment in the Gulf Stream ring and meander region and illustrates that an objective analysis using the parameter matrix can yield a more accurate representation of oceanic features than typical objective analysis techniques.},

SMOS has been selected by the European Space Agency as the second Earth Explorer Opportunity with a launch date in June 2005. The sensor embarked on SMOS is MIRAS, a Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis. MIRAS works at L-band, in the two-polarisations, and has full polarimetric capability. The measurement of <span class='snippet'>sea</span> surface salinity (SSS) is one of the challenges of SMOS. This paper presents first the scientific requirements for a number of oceanographic applications. The scientific requirements are then translated into instrument accuracy, sensitivity, stability and spatial resolution. Major sources of error in the retrieval of ocean salinity will be addressed through an experimental campaign which is described},

The technology behind such an achievement was developed, thanks to the effort of a community of researchers and engineers in different groups around the world. It was only because of their joint work that SMOS finally became a reality. The fact that the European Space Agency, together with CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) and CDTI (Centro para el Desarrollo TecnolÃ³gico e Industrial), managed to get the project through should be considered a merit and a reward for that entire community. This paper is an invited historical review that, within a very limited number of pages, tries to provide insight into some of the developments which, one way or another, are imprinted in the name of SMOS.},

  abstract = {A high-resolution model is used to characterize the dominant patterns of sea surface salinity (SSS) variability generated by the freshwater discharges of the Rio de la Plata (RdlP) and the Patos/Mirim Lagoon in the southwestern Atlantic region. We identify three dominant modes of SSS variability. The first two, which have been discussed in previous studies, represent the seasonal variations of the freshwater plumes over the continental shelf. The third mode of SSS variability, which has not been discussed hitherto, represents the salinity exchanges between the shelf and the deep ocean. A diagnostic study using floats and passive tracers identifies the pathways taken by the freshwater plumes. During the austral winter (JJA) the plumes leave the shelf region north of the BMC. During the austral summer (DJF), the plumes are entrained more directly into the BMC. A sensitivity study indicates that the high frequency component of the wind stress forcing controls the vertical structure of the plumes while the low-frequency component of the wind stress forcing and the inter-annual variations of the RdlP discharge controls the horizontal structure of the plumes. Dynamical analysis reveals that the cross-shelf flow has a dominant barotropic structure and, therefore, the SSS anomalies detected by Aquarius represent net mass exchanges between the shelf and the deep ocean. The net cross-shelf volume flux is 1.21 Sv. This outflow is largely compensated by an inflow from the Patagonian shelf.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the backscattering from multiscale soil surfaces through a comparison of analytical model predictions with numerical computations and experimental data. A numerical simulation of the backscatter from multiscale surfaces is performed in order to assess the sensitivity of the radar backscatter to the multiscale effect as a function of the roughness range of the surfaces, the polarization, and the incidence angle of the impinging electromagnetic wave. The numerical backscattering coefficients are compared with those obtained using the traditional integral equation method (IEM) as well as those obtained using a novel version of the IEM which has been adapted to model the backscattering from multiscale surfaces (MLS IEM). As a result, the surface conditions under which the traditional IEM can still predict well the backscatter from multiscale surfaces as well as the conditions under which traditional IEM fails are derived. Subsequently, 25 m long roughness profiles collected over the Marestaing test site located near Toulouse, France, are analyzed in order to estimate input parameters for the two versions of the IEM model. Then, a comparison is made between the single-scale IEM and MLS IEM predictions and ERS synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired over the site. The results show that over medium-rough soils (i.e., harrowed soils) the SLS IEM is in good agreement (within 1 dB) with ERS SAR data, whereas MLS IEM underestimates the measurements of 2-3 dB. In contrast, over very smooth soils (i.e., rolled soils) the MLS IEM is in overall better agreement with ERS SAR data than SLS IEM. The latter overestimates the measurements of 3 dB.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple zonal jets with the east-west velocity direction alternating with latitude are discovered in satellite altimetry data. The time-varying jets are shown to populate every part of the world ocean and its marginal seas and are best seen in the anomaly of geostrophic vorticity. At midlatitudes the jets have a meridional wavelength of about 300 kms with r.m.s. sea level, velocity and vorticity values of 2.4 cm, 6.9 cm/s and 1.5 Â· 10â6 sâ1, correspondingly. Realistic data from the high-resolution OGCM run on the Earth Simulator are used to justify high vertical coherence of the jets structure and relevance of the jets to an evolving mesoscale eddy field. Strong coupling between the jets and mesoscale eddies is hypothesized.},

Appropriate horizontal high-pass filtering applied to the ensemble-mean temperature at 100 m depth revealed the striation signal coherent with MDOT. The features are also distinct in the data of depth of 12Â°C isotherm lying close to the thermocline. The striations are oriented nearly zonally and coherent vertically at least through 700 m depth. Their wavelength is approximately 400 km, and the azimuth of wavevector is â13Â° (9Â°) in the northern (southern) domains. Correspondence between the striations in observations and OFES (OGCM for the Earth Simulator) model as well as the nature of the striations are discussed.},

In the Gulf Stream, this study demonstrates the importance of centrifugal force due to the curvature of the streamlines. After sorting out Ekman currents (using NCEP winds and improved parameterizations and by blending the mean dynamic ocean surface topography (MDOT) on large scale using the GRACE model, our data provide a global map of 1992-2002 MDOT at mesoscale resolution and unprecedented accuracy. This map, when used to revise the pattern of large-scale circulation, reveals a new jet in the South Atlantic. It also reveals for the first time distinct, steady, quasi-zonal jets in the eastern parts of practically all oceans. The MDOT data is released to public.},

The computer code obtained from this theory enables us to show that the range over which the incident field affects the surface current density is of the order of the radiation wavelength. This phenomenon is explained using a new approximate theory, able to express the scattered field in the form of an integral whose integrand is known in closed form. Using the rigorous computer code, we show that the new approximate theory is better than the Kirchhoff approximation in the resonance region. Finally, it is shown that the phenomenon of short interaction range of the incident field permits the rigorous computation of the field scattered from a rough surface of arbitrary width.},

  pages    = {632-645},
  volume   = {6},
  abstract = {Abstract El NiÃ±o is an anomalous condition that historically has been studied in the coastal region of the eastern tropical South Pacific. The phenomenon is commonly characterized there by the rapid appearance of anomalously high sea level and sea surface temperatures, and southward transport of the warmer, fresher equatorial waters. Observational evidence also suggests that El NiÃ±o is associated with a large-scale weakening of the equatorial wind systems over a large extent of the ocean interior. The problem investigated here is whether these ocean and atmosphere events are dynamically connected. A model is used to follow the initial baroclinic response of the eastern Pacific Ocean to different distributions of interior wind stress change. Model results suggest the following conclusions. Changes in the meridional wind field cannot cause an El NiÃ±o event. Changes in the zonal wind field outside of the equatorial band (roughly Â±5Â° of latitude) are not important in generating El NiÃ±o. A symmetric weakening of the equatorial zonal wind field can cause rapid lowering of the thermocline in the eastern Pacific; moreover, this lowering spreads all along the eastern boundary well out of the region of direct forcing and at higher latitudes is associated with poleward quasi-geostrophic coastal jets. An anti-symmetric change of the equatorial zonal wind field forces cross-equatorial transport; in this case, the anomaly fields do not spread along the eastern boundary but remain confined to the equatorial region. An asymmetric change of the equatorial zonal wind field has commonly observed aspects of El NiÃ±o; this response is defined to be a âmodelâ El NiÃ±o event. The model is of interest in itself. It is simple and analytic, and therefore its response can be understood in terms of familiar linear wave theory. After the swiftly propagating coastal Kelvin waves have passed through the model, the solution in the eastern Pacific can be viewed as a superposition of three parts: 1) a locally forced response, 2) packets of nondispersive Rossby waves excited at the eastern boundary, and 3) packets of equatorially trapped Kelvin waves arriving from the western boundary.},

  abstract = {A composite-roughness formulation of the geometrical optics approximation is applied to study the statistics of near-nadir electromagnetic scattering from the sea surface. For scattering from Gaussian random surfaces, the scattering cross section is dependent only on the probability density of surface slopes. The statistical distribution of the scattered intensity depends on both the slope probability density function and <| Omega;|> $the mean absolute value of the surface curvature. The curvature is of interest because it provides a measure of capillary wave spectra. Numerical results are obtained for scattering from isotropic surfaces for a fixed number N of specular scatterers and for N Poisson distributed. Obtaining viable estimates of <| Omega;|>, and hence of capillary wave spectra, from backscatter data at microwave frequencies may not be practical. Optical measurements for which individual point scatterers can be identified may, however, yield estimates of the surface curvature.},

  Abstract                 = {A major accomplishment of the recently completed Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program was the development of an ocean observing system to support seasonal-to-interannual climate studies. This paper reviews the scientific motivations for the development of that observing system, the technological advances that made it possible, and the scientific advances that resulted from the availability of a significantly expanded observational database. A primary phenomenological focus of TOGA was interannual variability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system associated with El Ni\'eo and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO).Prior to the start of TOGA, our understanding of the physical processes responsible for the ENSO cycle was limited, our ability to monitor variability in the tropical oceans was primitive, and the capability to predict ENSO was nonexistent. TOGA therefore initiated and/or supported efforts to provide real-time measurements of the following key oc\'eanographie variables: surface winds, sea surface temperature, subsurface temperature, sea level and ocean velocity. Specific in situ observational programs developed to provide these data sets included the Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean (TAO) array of moored buoys in the Pacific, a surface drifting buoy program, an island and coastal tide gauge network, and a volunteer observing ship network of expendable bathythermograph measurements. Complementing these in situ efforts were satellite missions which provided near-global coverage of surface winds, sea surface temperature, and sea level. These new TOGA data sets led to fundamental progress in our understanding of the physical processes responsible for ENSO and to the development of coupled ocean-atmosphere models for ENSO prediction.},

The mean difference between SSM/I and buoy winds is typically <0.4 m sâ1 when averaged over all operational Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean and National Data Buoy Center buoys for a given year, and the standard deviation is <1.4 m sâ1. Mean errors for a given satellite-buoy pair typically range from â1 to +1 m sâ1, with standard deviations <1.4 m sâ1. Two methods of converting buoy-measured wind speed to a standard value measured at a height of 10 m are compared. We find that the principal difference between a simple logarithmic correction and a more detailed conversion to 10 m equivalent neutral stability wind speed is a shift of wind speed by about 0.12 m sâ1 with no change in the distribution of SSM/I-buoy wind speed differences.},

Such measurements need a diurnal correction to prevent drifts in the satellites' measurement time from causing spurious trends. We have derived a diurnal correction that, in the tropics, is of the opposite sign from that previously applied. When we use this correction in the calculation of lower tropospheric temperature from satellite microwave measurements, we find tropical warming consistent with that found at the surface and in our satellite-derived version of middle/upper tropospheric temperature.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements made by the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) provide a multidecadal record of global atmospheric temperature change, which have been used by several groups to produce long-term temperature records of thick layers of the atmosphere from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere. Here we present an internal uncertainty estimate for the Remote Sensing Systems data sets made using a Monte Carlo approach that includes contributions to the total uncertainty from sampling error, premerge adjustments to each individual satellite, and the merging procedure. The results can be used to estimate uncertainties in this product at all space and time scales of interest to any specific application. On small space and time scales sampling effects dominate. On the longer time scales intersatellite merging is important at all levels and the diurnal adjustment is a critical uncertainty for the two layers that have a significant surface component, particularly over land. A comparison of trends for the globe, tropics, and extratropics between the best estimate data set along with these error estimates and homogenized radiosonde estimates and available MSU/AMSU estimates from other groups is undertaken. This shows consistency between our product and those produced by others within the stated uncertainty for many regions and layers. In almost as many cases, however, the interdata set differences of the estimated trends are too large be accounted for by the internal uncertainty estimates derived herein.},

  Abstract                 = {The European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission was launched on the 2nd of November 2009. The first six months after launch, the so-called commissioning phase, were dedicated to test the functionalities of the spacecraft, the instrument, and the ground segment including the data processors. This phase was successfully completed in May 2010, and SMOS has since been in the routine operations phase and providing data products to the science community for over a year. The performance of the instrument has been within specifications. A parallel processing chain has been providing brightness temperatures in near-real time to operational centers, e.g., the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Data quality has been within specifications; however, radio-frequency interference (RFI) has been detected over large parts of Europe, China, Southern Asia, and the Middle East. Detecting and flagging contaminated observations remains a challenge as well as contacting national authorities to localize and eliminate RFI sources emitting in the protected band. The generation of Level 2 soil moisture and ocean salinity data is an ongoing activity with continuously improved processors. This article will summarize the mission status after one year of operations and present selected first results.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a model function for the emissivity of the wind roughened ocean surface for microwave frequencies between 6 and 90 GHz. It is an update, refinement, and extension of model functions we had developed previously. The basis of our analysis are brightness temperature (TB) measurements from the spaceborne microwave radiometer WindSat and the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager, which are collocated with independent measurements of surface wind speeds and directions. This allows the determination of the emissivity model function for Earth incidence angles (EIA) around 55Â°. We demonstrate that an essential part in the model development is the absolute calibration of the radiometer measurements over the ocean to the computed TB of the radiative transfer model, one of whose components the emissivity model function is. We combine our results with other established measurements for lower EIA and finally obtain a model function which can be used over the whole EIA range between 0Â° and 65Â°. Results for both the isotropic, wind direction independent part as well as the four Stokes parameters of the wind direction signal are presented. Special emphasis is made on the behavior at high wind speeds between 20 and 40 m/s by conducting a comparison with data from the step frequency microwave radiometer.},

We derive a geophysical model function (GMF) for the emission and backscatter of L-band microwave radiation from rough ocean surfaces. The analysis is based on radiometer brightness temperature and scatterometer backscatter observations both taken on board Aquarius. The data are temporally and spatially collocated with wind speeds from WindSat and F17 SSMIS (Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder) and wind directions from NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction) GDAS (Global Data Assimilation System). This GMF is the basis for retrieval of ocean surface wind speed combining L-band H-pol radiometer and HH-pol scatterometer observations. The accuracy of theses combined passive/active L-band wind speeds matches those of many other satellite microwave sensors. The L-band GMF together with the combined passive/active L-band wind speeds are utilized in the Aquarius SSS retrieval algorithm for the surface roughness correction. We demonstrate that using these L-band wind speeds instead of NCEP wind speeds leads to a significant improvement in the SSS accuracy. Further improvements in the roughness correction algorithm can be obtained by adding VV-pol scatterometer measurements and wave height (WH) data into the GMF.},

Range delay, interferometric phase bias, range defocusing, and Faraday rotation are the most prominent ones. All the effects are a function of the so-called total electron content (TEC). Methods based on two-frequency global positioning system observations allow measuring TEC in the ionosphere with coarse spatial resolution only. In this letter, the potential of broadband L-band SAR systems for ionospheric TEC mapping is studied. As a basis, the dispersive nature of the ionosphere and its effects on broadband microwave radiation are theoretically derived and analyzed. It is shown that phase advance and group delay can be measured by interferometric and correlation techniques, respectively. The achievable accuracy suffices in mapping small-scale ionospheric TEC disturbances. A differential TEC estimator that separates ionospheric from tropospheric contributions is proposed},

  abstract = {With the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor PALSAR onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite, a new full-polarimetric spaceborne L-band SAR instrument has been launched into orbit. At L-band, Faraday rotation (FR) can reach significant values, degrading the quality of the received SAR data. One-way rotations exceeding 25 deg are likely to happen during the lifetime of PALSAR, which will significantly reduce the accuracy of geophysical parameter recovery if uncorrected. Therefore, the estimation and correction of FR effects is a prerequisite for data quality and continuity. In this paper, methods for estimating FR are presented and analyzed. The first unambiguous detection of FR in SAR data is presented. A set of real data examples indicates the quality and sensitivity of FR estimation from PALSAR data, allowing the measurement of FR with high precision in areas where such measurements were previously inaccessible. In examples, we present the detection of kilometer-scale ionospheric disturbances, a spatial scale that is not detectable by ground-based GPS measurements. An FR prediction method is presented and validated. Approaches to correct for the estimated FR effects are applied, and their effectiveness is tested on real data.},

  Abstract                 = {The subject here is generalized (i.e., non-Gaussian) noise models, and specifically their first-order probability density functions (PDFs). Attention is focused primarily on the author's canonical statistical-physical Class A and Class B models. In particular, Class A noise describes the type of electromagnetic interference (EMI) often encountered in telecommunication applications, where this ambient noise is largely due to other, ldquo;intelligent rdquo; telecommunication operations. On the other hand, ambient Class B noise usually represents man-made or natural ldquo;nonintelligent rdquo;-i.e., nonmessage-bearing noise-and is highly impulsive. Class A noise is not an alpha;-stable process, nor is it reducible to such, except in the limiting Gaussian cases of high-density noise (by the central limit theorem). Class B noise is also asymptotically normal (before model approximation). Under rather broad conditions, principally governed by the source propagation and distribution scenarios, the PDF of Class B noise alone (no Gaussian component) can usually be approximated by (1) a symmetric Gaussian alpha;-stable (S alpha;S) model in the case of narrowband reception, or when the PDF omega;1( alpha;) of the amplitude is symmetric; and (2) a nonsymmetric alpha;-stable (NS alpha;S) model (no Gaussian component) can be constructed in broadband regimes. New results here include: (i) counting functional methods for constructing the general qth-order characteristic functions (CFs) of Class A and Class B noise, from which (all) moments and (in principle), the PDFs follow; (ii) the first-order CFs, PDFs, and cumulative probabilities (APDs) of nonsymmetric broadband Class B noise, extended to include additive Gauss noise (AGN); (iii) proof of the existence of all moments in the basic Class A and Class B models; (iv) the key physical role of AGN and the fact that AGN removes alpha;-stability; (v) the explicit roles of the propagation and distribution scenarios; and (vi) extension to noise fields. Although telecommunication applications are emphasized, Class A and Class B noise models apply selectively, but equally well, to other physical regimes, e.g., underwater acoustics and EM (radar, optics, etc.). Supportive empirical data are included},

  abstract = {Effective signal processing in active regimes requires appropriate measurement and statistical modeling of the (usually) dominant scatter returns. Here the critical situation of threshold signal detection is considered, when the clutter (for radar) and reverberation (for sonar) are generally non-Gaussian. The latter is a common condition for operation, particularly at small grazing angles, e.g., with radar off sea and land surfaces, and for sonar in shallow water, where surface and bottom interaction are significant. Two examples of constrained optimization, namely incoherent reception employing instantaneous amplitudes and envelopes, illustrate the statistical role of the non-Gaussian returns in signal processing. The threshold detection algorithms are locally optimum Bayes and locally asymptotically normal. In particular, they are also canonical, i.e., formally independent of the particular physics involved, as are the performance measures, expressed now as probabilities of detection (PD) and false alarms ( alpha;F). The principal emphasis here, however, is on the statistical description of the (signal-dependent) scatter process, including also accompanying ambient and system noise, and (unwanted) ldquo;large rdquo; reflectors (terrain features and wave surface structure). The derivation of probability distributions (pdf's) is based on the author's earlier counting functional techniques and Decomposition Principle (DP), which here can account for multiple scatter contributions. The resulting non-Gaussian scatter processes include the new KA (i.e., ldquo;bunched rdquo; Class A) model. This is a generalization of the earlier K-clutter models and one which permits a statistical description of many scatter scenarios not physically covered by the latter. Another significant result is the demonstration of the equivalence of the new approach to the formulations of classical scattering theory. Since, unlike the present method, the latter is not generally capable of providing analytic results for probability densities, this new approach provides a significant advance over previous methods by generating the needed physically derived pdf's for effective signal processing. This paper is in part a work in progress: it includes a discussion of method, a variety of analytical and empirical results and needed next steps, some illustrative comparisons with empirical sonar and radar data, and an Appendix on the physical justification of the gamma pdf for fluctuation scatter intensities},

The new conditions involve nonzero velocity gradients, absorbing media, and multiple reflections, as well as the usual Doppler, general signals and apertures, and mono- and bistatic operation. Of principal interest are the mean return (specular reflection), the mean intensity, and the covariance of these generally nonstationary processes, following reception by the receiving aperture. These we determine under the basic Poisson assumptions of primarily independent single scattering, as before. Also of major importance are the auto- and cointensity spectra associated with the various second-order statistics. General relations for these and higher order moments are indicated. The quasi-stationary cases of "short" narrow-band signals occur in many practical operational situations and are treated here in detail, under a variety of general and special conditions, appropriate to both oceanographic and general communication applications (e.g., detection and classification). The development of our quasi-phenomenological model (Parts I-IV) concludes with a critique of the role of the Poisson assumption of independent scatterers in both volume and surface scatter and a short account of possible and needed extensions of the present "macroscopic" theory to one that is fully physical at the "microscopic" level as well.},

  abstract = {It is proposed that wind-generated solitons (hydraulic "jumps"), moving nondispersively on the thin wind-driven drift layer of wind-excited (ocean) wave surfaces, are: a) important products of the process whereby wind-wave surfaces are generated; b) potentially significant in low-angle high-frequency (for example,X-band radar) scattering from such surfaces; and c) a plausible mechanism responsible for the observed anomalous (vis- #224;-vis conventional theory) large backscatter returns in underwater acoustics when high frequencies and small grazing angles (phi lt; 20deg) are employed, in the absence of significant near-surface bubble layers [1]. When the local atmospheric conditions are such that significant bubble densities are created (principally by breaking waves), the resulting bubble layer will dominate and mask these solitons, in underwater acoustic scattering. They should, however, remain effective at low angles and high frequencies in electromagnetic (EM) or radar scattering from above the surface, unless surface spray is heavy. A qualitative mixed linear-nonlinear model of ocean-wave generation is briefly described, a key element of which is the production of soliton ensembles. These are created, and destroyed, on the moving gravity-wave "facets" of the developing wind-wave surface, along with accompanying capillary components. Unlike these gravity-capillary waves, which are dispersive, the solitons are nondispersive, i.e., move at constant speed, on the thin (moving) wind drift layer generated upon the upper part of the water surface. A variety of experimental data and evidence [2]-[7], [10]- [14], [17] is cited and discussed in support of the proposed soliton mechanism. Included are recent results for acoustic backscatter at small grazing angles in the frequency range 5-20 kHz [5], based on a Poisson model for the soliton statistics [1], which yields a theoretical soliton wavenumber spectrum of the formW_{2}(k|0) = A{1 + (bk)^{2}}^{-2}. The inferred parameters of the soliton structure are consistent with experimental observations of the acoustic baekscatter [5]. They also suggest the critical role of the near-surface locally turbulent winds. These are inadequately parameteri- zed by mean wind speed (bar{U}_{a}) alone: higher moments (varbar{U}_{a}, etc.) are needed to account for the often markedly different wave surface states and resulting spectra, backscatter levels, etc., for the unsaturated nltragravity and capillary wavenumber regions (1/2-6 rad.cm{-1}), which are consistently observed in practice [2], [3], [11], [13]. Finally, it is emphasized that, at this stage, the aim is to demonstrate feasibility and plausibility, not a full proof of the proposed mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {A unique barrier layer (BL) system in terms of persistence, extension, and associated subsurface temperature maximum is present seasonally in the northwestern tropical Atlantic. Based on climatological output of a general circulation ocean model, we show here that its development consists of two phases. In summer, the BL is relatively shallow and thin but subsurface temperature maxima are intense. The latter develop as a result of the specific seasonality of the freshwater discharge in this area, which limits the mixed layer to a very thin depth while the intense radiative heat flux penetrates significantly below, thereby heating the subsurface waters protected from air-sea interactions and inducing a barrier layer between the mixed layer and the ocean interior. In winter, the BL development is due to a surface decrease in salinity associated with the surface freshwater capping, which decouples the pycnocline, and hence the winter mixed layer, from the thermocline. The mechanism is ubiquitous in the sense that it is very similar to that of other areas at the same latitude, as well as at high latitudes in regions of seasonal surface freshening. Results are discussed in the light of a simple linear equation linking the BL development to time evolution of Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Surface Salinity stratification.},

  Abstract                 = {The Rayleigh hypothesis is reviewed in relation to scattering by periodic surfaces, aperiodic surfaces, and bounded, two-dimensional bodies. Conditions for its validity are described, and explicit results are quoted for a sinusoidal grating. Some methods to solve scattering problems for periodic surfaces are outlined. One particular procedure for periodic surfaces and bounded scatterers is examined in detail. This involves an expansion for the scattered field in terms of the same sets of elementary wavefunctions that occur in connection with the Rayleigh hypothesis. The coefficients are determined by satisfying the boundary condition in the least-squares sense. It is shown that this solution converges uniformly to the scattered field at all points exterior to the boundary of the scatterer. Necessary completeness properties of the sets of wavefunctions are established in the appendices.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT A technique for locating possible singularities of two-dimensional ex-terior harmonic functions was discussed in a previous paper. In the present work, the method is generalized to exterior solutions of the Helmholtz equation. Although the procedure deviates in some of its details from the earlier exposition, the conclusions are similar. In particular, it is verified that solutions of the Laplace and Helmholtz equations that satisfy the same Dirichlet boundary condition on the same boundary, possess the same convex hull of singularities. The possibility of extending the method to more general equations is raised.},

  Annote                   = {Fundamental determinations of the physical properties of seawater have previously been made for Atlantic surface waters, referred to as ``Standard Seawater''. In this paper a Reference Composition consisting of the major components of Atlantic surface seawater is determined using these earlier analytical measurements. The stoichiometry of sea salt introduced here is thus based on the most accurate prior determination of the composition, adjusted to achieve charge balance and making use of the 2005 atomic weights. Reference Seawater is defined as any seawater that has the Reference Composition and a new Reference-Composition Salinity SR is defined to provide the best available estimate of the Absolute Salinity of both Reference Seawater and the Standard Seawater that was used in the measurements of the physical properties. From a practical point of view, the value of SR can be related to the Practical Salinity S by S R = ( 35.16504 / 35 ) g kg - 1 ÃS . Reference Seawater that has been ``normalized''to a Practical Salinity of 35 has a Reference-Composition Salinity of exactly SR=35.16504 g kgâ1. The new independent salinity variable SR is intended to be used as the concentration variable for future thermodynamic functions of seawater, as an SI-based extension of Practical Salinity, as a reference for natural seawater composition anomalies, as the currently best estimate for Absolute Salinity of IAPSO Standard Seawater, and as a theoretical model for the electrolyte mixture ``seawater''.},

  Abstract                 = {Radio frequency interference (RFI) detection techniques have different challenges and opportunities for interferometric radiometers such as the Microwave Imaging Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis on the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. SMOS does not have highly oversampled temporal resolution or subband filters for oversampled spectral resolution, as do other radiometers with enhanced RFI detection capabilities. It does, however, have multisampled angular resolution in the sense that a single location is viewed from many different angles of incidence. This paper compares and contrasts RFI detection algorithms that use measurements made at a variety of different levels of SMOS signal processing, including the visibility domain, brightness temperature spatial domain, and brightness temperature angular domain. The angular domain detection algorithm, in particular, is developed and characterized in detail. Examples of the algorithms applied to cases with RFI (to assess detection skill) and without RFI (to assess false-alarm behavior) are considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Two problems involving electromagnetic scattering from irregular interfaces are treated, both deterministic and statistical irregularities being considered. First, reflection of a partially polarized plane wave from a plane interface with large irregularities is studied using geometrical optics. Matrix transformations relating incident and reflected waves are obtained for reflection from a single specular point and from an extended area containing many independent reflectors. The properties of a wave reflected from a diffusely illuminated rough interface are found, and these results are used to study reflection noise reduction when a polarization-sensitive detector viewing near the Brewster angle is used in infrared temperature measurements. Second, the method of small perturbations is used to study scattering of an arbitrary completely polarized wave from an irregular interface of general underlying shape. The irregularities are replaced by equivalent surface currents and then the field in space is found using the dyadic Green's functions of the unperturbed problem. The results obtained are valid when the irregularity has small slope and amplitude small compared to the wavelength and local radii of curvature. To facilitate applications, the theory of dyadic Green's functions is developed, and the necessary functions are evaluated for simple geometries. As an example, the first perturbation is calculated for scattering from a perfectly conducting cylinder with sinusoidal irregularities.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}As a first step towards a generalization of the Maggi-Rubinowicz theory of the boundary diffraction wave, a new vector potential W(Q,P) is associated with any monochromatic scalar wavefield U(P). This potential has the property that the normal component of its curl, taken with respect to the coordinates of any point Q on a closed surface S surrounding a field point P, is equal to the integrand of the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral; that is, \[Equation\], where s is the distance QP and $\partial$/$\partial$n denotes the differentiation along the inward unit normal n to S.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Further it is shown that the vector potential always has singularities at some points Q on S and that the field at P may be rigorously expressed as the sum of disturbances propagated from these points alone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}A closed expression for the vector potential associated with any given monochromatic wavefield that obeys the Sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity is derived and it is shown that in the special case when U is a spherical wave, this expression reduces to that found by G.

  Abstract                 = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}With the help of the results derived in Part I of this investigation, a new representation is obtained for the field arising from diffraction of a monochromatic wave by an aperture in an opaque screen. It is shown that within the accuracy of the Kirchhoff diffraction theory, the diffracted field UK(P) may be expressed under very general conditions in the form Uk(P)$=$U(B)(P)$+$$\Sigma$iFi(P). (1) Here U(B) represents a disturbance originating at each point of the boundary of the aperture and $\Sigma$iFi(P) represents the total effect of disturbances propagated from certain special points Qi in the aperture. Expressions for U(B) and Fi(P) are given, in terms of the new vector potential which was introduced in the previous paper.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the special case when the wave incident upon the aperture is plane or spherical, the last term in (1) is found to represent a wave disturbance U(G)(P) which obeys the laws of geometrical optics. The formula (1) then becomes equivalent to a classical result of Maggi and Rubinowicz, which may be regarded as a mathematical refinement of early ideas of Young about the nature of diffraction. It is shown further, that even when the incident wave is not plane or spherical, the last term in (1) is, at least approximately, equal to a ``geometrical wave.''{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The results suggest a new approach to the solution of certain types of diffraction problems and provide a new insight into the process of diffraction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract = {A newly available sea surface salinity (SSS) measurement from Aquarius/SAC-D satellite reveals strong seasonal variability in the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The seasonal SSS variability at skin layer differs/agrees regionally in their amplitude from/with Argo-measured salinity at 5 m depth and model salinity at the top layer, indicating various characteristics of near-surface salinity stratifications. By comparing the three different salinity products, we have examined the near-surface salinity stratifications with emphasis on the dynamical processes that differ from one region to another. Our analysis shows that for the western part of tropical Atlantic and southern tropical Indian, a large amount of river runoff and/or surface freshwater significantly stratifies the surface layer above 5m depth, resulting in the differences among the Aquarius, Argo and model. Differently for the southern Arabian Sea, the surface water can be mixed down to the depth of 5 m due to seasonally reversing currents driven by monsoons, resulting in an agreement among the datasets. The comparison suggests that dynamical differences can lead to different vertical salinity stratifications locally, which explain the differences between the Aquarius observations in the first cm of the sea surface, the Argo measurements at the 5m depth, and modelâs representation of the surface-layer averaged salinity.},

  abstract = {The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Doppler centroid has been used to estimate the scatter line-of-sight radar velocity. In weak to moderate ocean surface current environment, the SAR Doppler centroid is dominated by the directionality and strength of wave-induced ocean surface displacements. In this paper, we show how this sea state signature can be used to improve surface wind retrieval from SAR. Doppler shifts of C-band radar return signals from the ocean are thoroughly investigated by colocating wind measurements from the ASCAT scatterometer with Doppler centroid anomalies retrieved from Envisat ASAR. An empirical geophysical model function (CDOP) is derived, predicting Doppler shifts at both VV and HH polarization as function of wind speed, radar incidence angle, and wind direction with respect to radar look direction. This function is used into a Bayesian inversion scheme in combination with wind from a priori forecast model and the normalized radar cross section (NRCS). The benefit of Doppler for SAR wind retrieval is shown in complex meteorological situations such as atmospheric fronts or low pressure systems. Using in situ information, validation reveals that this method helps to improve the wind direction retrieval. Uncertainty of the calibration of Doppler shift from Envisat ASAR hampers the inversion scheme in cases where NRCS and model wind are accurate and in close agreement. The method is however very promising with respect of future SAR missions, in particular Sentinel-1, where the Doppler centroid anomaly will be more robustly retrieved.},

	using an observation-based approach that combines altimetry with
	temperature and salinity through the thermal wind equation. The validity
	of this simple approach was tested using a consistent dataset from
	a model reanalysis. Away from the boundary layers, errors are less
	than 10% in most places, which indicate that the thermal wind equation
	is a robust approximation to reconstruct the 3D oceanic circulation
	in the ocean interior. The Surcouf3D current field was validated
	in the Atlantic Ocean against in-situ observations. We considered
	the \{ANDRO\} current velocities deduced at 1000& #{xa0;m depth from Argo float displacements as well as velocity measurements at 26.5Â°N from the RAPID-MOCHA current meter array. The Surcouf3D currents show similar skill to the 3D velocities from the \{GLORYS\} Mercator Ocean reanalysis in reproducing the amplitude and variability of the \{ANDRO\} currents. In the upper 1000&} # xa0;m, high correlations are also found with in-situ velocities
	measured by the RAPID-MOCHA current meters. The Surcouf3D current
	field was then used to compute estimates of the Atlantic Meridional
	Overturning Circulation (AMOC) through the 25Â°N section, showing
	good comparisons with hydrographic sections from 1998 and 2004. Monthly
	averaged \{AMOC\} time series are also consistent with the RAPID-MOCHA
	array and with the \{GLORYS\} Mercator Ocean reanalysis over the
	April 2004âSeptember 2007 period. Finally a 15 years long time
	series of monthly estimates of the \{AMOC\} was computed. The \{AMOC\}
	strength has a mean value of 16& #{xa0;Sv with an annual (resp. monthly) standard deviation of 2.4&} # xa0;Sv (resp. 7.1& #{xa0;Sv) over the 1993â2008 period. The time series, characterized by a strong variability, shows no significant trend.},

  abstract = {Without deep mixing, the ocean would turn, within a few thousand years, into a stagnant pool of cold salty water with equilibrium maintained locally by near-surface mixing and with very weak convectively driven surface-intensified circulation. (This result follows from SandstrÃ¶mâs theorem for a fluid heated and cooled at the surface.) In this context we revisit the 1966 âAbyssal Recipesâ, which called for a diapycnal diffusivity of 10-4m2/s (1&} # xa0;cgs) to maintain the abyssal stratification against global
	upwelling associated with 25& #{xa0;Sverdrups of deep water formation. Subsequent microstructure measurements gave a pelagic diffusivity (away from topography) of 10-5&} # xa0;m2/s â a low value confirmed by dye release experiments.
	A new solution (without restriction to constant coefficients) leads
	to approximately the same values of global upwelling and diffusivity,
	but we reinterpret the computed diffusivity as a surrogate for a
	small number of concentrated sources of buoyancy flux (regions of
	intense mixing) from which the water masses (but not the turbulence)
	are exported into the ocean interior. Using the Levitus climatology
	we find that 2.1& #{xa0;TW (terawatts) are required to maintain the global abyssal density distribution against 30&} # xa0;Sverdrups of deep water formation. The winds and tides are
	the only possible source of mechanical energy to drive the interior
	mixing. Tidal dissipation is known from astronomy to equal 3.7 \{TW\}
	(2.50Â±0.05& #{xa0;TW from \{M2\} alone), but nearly all of this has traditionally been allocated to dissipation in the turbulent bottom boundary layers of marginal seas. However, two recent TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetric estimates combined with dynamical models suggest that 0.6â0.9&} # xa0;TW may be available for abyssal mixing. A recent estimate of
	wind-driving suggests 1& #{xa0;TW of additional mixing power. All values are very uncertain. A surprising conclusion is that the equator-to-pole heat flux of 2000&#xa0;TW associated with the meridional overturning circulation would not exist without the comparatively minute mechanical mixing sources. Coupled with the findings that mixing occurs at a few dominant sites, there is a host of questions concerning the maintenance of the present climate state, but also that of paleoclimates and their relation to detailed continental configurations, the history of the EarthâMoon system, and a possible great sensitivity to details of the wind system.},

  Abstract                 = {The 2-D interferometric radiometer on board the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite has been providing a continuous data set of brightness temperatures, at different viewing geometries, containing information of the Earth's surface microwave emission. This data set is affected by several sources of noise, which are a combination of the noise associated with the radiometer itself and the different views under which a heterogeneous target, such as continental surfaces, is observed. As a result, the SMOS data set is affected by a significant amount of noise. For many applications, such as soil moisture retrieval, reducing noise from the observations while keeping the signal is necessary, and the accuracy of the retrievals depends on the quality of the observed data set. This paper investigates the averaging of SMOS brightness temperatures in angular bins of different sizes as a simple method to reduce noise. All the observations belonging to a single pixel and satellite overpass were fitted to a polynomial regression model, with the objective of characterizing and evaluating the associated noise. Then, the observations were averaged in angular bins of different sizes, and the potential benefit of this process to reduce noise from the data was quantified. It was found that, if a 2$^{circ}$ angular bin is used to average the data, the noise is reduced by up to 3 K. Furthermore, this method complements necessary data thinning approaches when a large volume of data is used in data assimilation systems.},

Aspects of DCV arising either from internal climate variability or from natural external forcing were described. The potential predictability from these sources, and also from the influence of anthropogenic external forcing is considered.

  abstract = {1] Algorithms are developed for the estimation of sea surface salinity (SSS) in the tropical Indian Ocean from the space-borne satellite measurements of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The algorithms are based on the interrelationships between OLR, the effective oceanic layer (EOL), climatological SSS (World Ocean Atlas 1998 (WOA98)), and freshwater flux (P-E). Coupling between the atmospheric convection (OLR) and the geopotential thickness of the oceanic near-surface stratified layer (EOL) forms the main relationship for the estimation of SSS, followed by the relationships between EOL and WOA98 SSS and between OLR and P-E. The SSS has been estimated using 16 years (1979-1994) of OLR data and the algorithms for the tropical Indian Ocean. The estimated SSS at 2.5\B0 Ã 2.5\B0 grid on monthly scale is nearer to the WOA98 SSS with lower differences within Â±0.5-0.8 away from the coastal region. The estimated SSS also agrees reasonably with the observed SSS along the trans-Indian zonal sections occupied during World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and also other sections. The SSS differences bring out clearly the impact of the strong 1997-1998 El NiÃ±o on the rainfall in the southeastern Indian Ocean and the eastern equatorial region. On the basis of the results, the seasonal and interannual variability of SSS in the tropical Indian Ocean are discussed. Through a physical model, phase lags between P-E and SSS and between OLR and P-E are estimated and their incorporation into the algorithms is suggested for improvement in the estimation of SSS. This SSS information is useful to the studies on coupled models, El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation forecast models, and Ocean Global Circulation Models or regional scale circulation models.},

This study utilized three different fractal approaches--isarithm, triangular prism, and variogram--to characterize texture features of urban land-cover classes in high-resolution image data. For comparison purpose and to better evaluate the efficiency of fractal approaches in image classification, spatial autocorrelation techniques (Moran's I and Geary's C ), simple standard deviation, and mean of the selected features were also examined in this study. The discriminant analysis was carried out to discriminate between classes of urban land cover on the basis of texture measures (variables). This study demonstrated that the spatial autocorrelation approach was superior to the fractal approaches. In some cases, simple standard deviation and mean value of the samples gave better accuracy than all or some of the fractal approaches. The results obtained from this analysis suggest that fractal-based textural discrimination methods are applicable but these methods alone may be ineffective in extracting texture features or identifying different land-use and land-cover classes in remotely sensed images.},

An analysis of the observations revealed that salinity decreased significantly at the density range of 26.6?26.8 ÃÂ? in the western subtropical gyre, including the mixed water region (MWR). The temporal variability of the salinity is dominated by the marked change in the late 1970s. With results similar to the observations, the model, selectively forced by the interannual variability of the wind-driven ocean circulation, simulated significant freshening of the intermediate layer over the subtropical gyre. The significant freshening is related to the increase in southward transport of the Oyashio associated with the intensification of the Aleutian low. Accompanying these changes, the intrusion of fresh and low potential vorticity water, originating in the Okhotsk Sea, to the MWR increased, and the freshening signal propagated farther southward in the western subtropical gyre during the subsequent 6 yr, crossing the Kuroshio Extension. These results indicate that the multidecadal-scale freshening of the NPIW is partly caused by intensification of the wind-driven cross-gyre transport of the subarctic water to the subtropical gyre.

  abstract = {WindSat has provided an opportunity to investigate the first spaceborne passive fully polarimetric observations of the Earth's surface. In this paper, Arctic sea ice was investigated. The passive polarimetric data are provided in the form of the modified Stokes vector consisting of four parameters. The first two components of the modified Stokes vector are the vertically and horizontally polarized brightness temperatures, which have been continuously measured by various radiometers over the last three decades. The third and fourth Stokes components provide in formation on the degree of polarization of the emission. In this paper, three types of analysis are carried out: spatial (maps considering different azimuth angle intervals), temporal (time series of daily averaged Stokes components over a small selected azimuth angle range), and azimuthal (variations w.r.t. the azimuth angle over selected study areas). Analysis has shown the highest brightness temperature variations for the 37-GHz third Stokes component ( gt;; 2 K) during summer. The next highest signals were observed for the 10.7-GHz third and fourth Stokes components ( gt;; 1 K) during summer as well. The 37-GHz fourth Stokes component exhibited the least variability ( gt;; 1 K). Spikes of up to 2 K were identified in the time series of the 37-GHz third Stokes component during mid-January 2004 (winter) over first-year ice regions. The near-surface air temperature of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model data and the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager National Aeronautics and Space Administration Team ice concentrations revealed that, during these events, the surface temperatures reached near melting levels and the retrieved ice concentrations were reduced to about 80%. Moreover, these observations also showed clear evidence of first harmonic azimuthal dependence. Geophysical parameters, such as temperature and ice leads, are likely to be the causes. The larger signals which occurred d uring summer were identified as being related to the ice surface temperatures being near melting.},

  abstract = {Surface cooling induced by tropical cyclones (TCs) is about three times larger during premonsoon than during postmonsoon season in the Bay of Bengal. We investigate processes responsible for this seasonal contrast using an ocean general circulation model. The model is forced by TC winds prescribed from an analytic vortex using observed TC tracks and intensities during 1978-2007. The simulation accurately captures the seasonal cycle of salinity, temperature, and barrier layer in this region, with fresher waters, deeper upper-ocean stratification, and thicker barrier layers during postmonsoon season. It also reproduces the three times larger TC-induced cooling during premonsoon than during postmonsoon season. This difference is essentially related to seasonal changes in oceanic stratification rather than to differences in TC wind energy input. During the postmonsoon season, a deeper thermal stratification combined with a considerable upper-ocean freshening strongly inhibits surface cooling induced by vertical mixing underneath TCs. On average, thermal stratification accounts for â¼60% of this cooling reduction during postmonsoon season, while haline stratification accounts for the remaining 40%. Their respective contributions however strongly vary within the Bay: haline stratification explains a large part of the TC-induced cooling inhibition offshore of northern rim of the Bay (Bangladesh-Myanmar-east coast of India), where salinity seasonal changes are the strongest, while thermal stratification explains all the cooling inhibition in the southwestern Bay. This study hence advocates for an improved representation of upper-ocean salinity and temperature effects in statistical and dynamical TCs forecasts that could lead to significant improvements of TC intensity prediction skill.},

Off-nadir backscatter data of ocean surfaces were obtained in the presence of large waves with significant wave height up to 5.6 m. In moderate-wind cases, effects of large waves are not detectable within the measurement uncertainty and no noticeable correlation between backscatter coefficients and wave height is found. Under high-wave light-wind conditions, backscatter is enhanced significantly at large incidence angles,with a weaker effect at small incidence angles. Backscatter coefficients in the wind speed range under consideration are compared with SASS-II (Ku band), CMOD3-H1 (C band), and Plant's model results which confirm the experimental observations. Variations of the friction velocity, which can give rise to the observed backscatter behaviors in the presence of large waves, are presented},

  Abstract                 = {The Jet Propulsion Laboratory NUSCAT Ku-band scatterometer successfully acquired ocean backscatter data over a wide variety of oceanic and atmospheric conditions during the Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment (SWADE). Ten flights resulted in 30 h of data collection were conducted on the NASA Ames C130 aircraft. The SWADE experimental area was deployed with several buoys providing appropriate in situ measurements to correlate with the radar backscatter for incidence angles from 10 to 60 deg; at both horizontal and vertical polarizations. The NUSCAT-SWADE backscatter data base was utilized in conjunction with buoy measurements to investigate ocean backscatter signatures over the range of conditions encountered during SWADE. To account for modulations and fluctuations in incidence angles, a backscatter analysis independent of a priori geophysical model functions was developed, tested, and implemented. Results for backscatter azimuth modulations in terms of upwind, downwind, and crosswind radar returns are compared to airborne RADSCAT results and to SASS-I and II geophysical model functions versus neutral wind speed (UN). NUSCAT-SWADE results are closest overall to SASS-II values, fit best with SASS-I at 10 deg; incidence angle, and are significantly higher than RADSCAT. Effects of friction velocity (u*), wave age (co/u*), and significant wave height (H1/3) on ocean backscatter are studied. The backscatter shows a good positive sensitivity to u*, an inverse dependence on co/u*, and no systematic trend with H1/3 excluding cases of large swells. Coefficients of empirical relations between backscatter and neutral wind speed, friction velocity, and wave age are derived for 10-40 deg; incidence angles at both horizontal and vertical polarizations. Covariance studies of backscatter with the derived relations to winds show an overall deviation factor in the order of 1 dB for ocean signatures including uncertainties in surface conditions},

  Abstract                 = {Oceans and 2D turbulence present similar characteristics, as for instance the dominant role played by eddies in energy and matter transport. However, providing a complete justification of this analogy is difficult, as it requires knowledge of the ocean's dynamic state at different instants and over large scales. Recently, new techniques coming from the Microcanonical Multifractal Formalism have made it possible to infer the streamlines from the analysis of satellite images of some scalar variables. In this paper, we will show that this information is enough to characterize the scaling properties of the energy cascade, which is manifested as a multifractal signature; further, the multifractal signature is obtained at each location in a local basis. Different scalars obtained from satellite measurements such as Sea Surface Temperature or Surface Chlorophyll Concentration present essentially the same multifractal structure, which is interpreted as a consequence of the pervading character of the turbulent advection at the scales of observation.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper describes near-surface horizontal salt flux in the Indian Ocean during 1960-2008 using the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation Reanalysis version 2.2.4. The long term mean salt flux shows seasonal reversals that are more pronounced in the northern Indian Ocean than in the southern Indian Ocean. Mean zonal salt flux is of a higher magnitude than the mean meridional salt flux. Wyrtki jets influence zonal salt flux in the equatorial region. Meridional salt flux is northward along the northeast (NE) African coast and western Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the southwest monsoon season. The opposite holds during the NE monsoon season. Empirical orthogonal function analyses of salt flux show that the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) primarily controls interannual variability with flux being westward during positive dipole events and eastward during negative dipole events. The co-occurrence of IOD with the El Ni\~no Southern Ocean results in enhanced salt flux especially along the equatorial region. Spatially, the most variable regions are the NE African coast, eastern Arabian Sea, BoB and equatorial regions. This study will help interpret salinity data for the Indian Ocean from the recently launched Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity and Aquarius satellite salinity missions.},

The probability density is based on the Kac-Siegert solution of Volterra's stochastic series expansion of a nonlinear system. A method is developed, however, to obtain the Kac-Siegert solution from knowledge of the time history only of the random process, and the result is expressed as a function of a normal distribution. Then, by applying the change of random variable technique, the asymptotic probability density function applicable to the response of a nonlinear system (which is a non-Gaussian random process) is developed in closed form. A comparison of the presently developed probability density function and the histogram constructed from a record indicating strong non-Gaussian characteristics shows excellent agreement.},

This numerical investigation avoids some of the complications present in experimental studies of the effects of this parameter, such as instrument resolution and measurement reproducibility. The numerical technique is used to generate surfaces with exponential correlation functions and surfaces with gaussian correlations. The short-wavelength fluctuations on the exponential surfaces are clearly seen, these arising from the high-frequency tail in the surface power spectrum. The authors are able to quantify the sampling interval necessary to record this short-range surface behaviour. They conclude that the sampling interval must be at least as small as one tenth of the surface correlation length, for these high-frequency variations to be recorded and hence for the inherent exponential nature of the surface to be measured.},

  Abstract                 = {Water is a naturally circulating resource that is constantly recharged. Therefore, even though the stocks of water in natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful to increase the available water resources for human society, the flow of water should be the main focus in water resources assessments. The climate system puts an upper limit on the circulation rate of available renewable freshwater resources (RFWR). Although current global withdrawals are well below the upper limit, more than two billion people live in highly water-stressed areas because of the uneven distribution of RFWR in time and space. Climate change is expected to accelerate water cycles and thereby increase the available RFWR. This would slow down the increase of people living under water stress; however, changes in seasonal patterns and increasing probability of extreme events may offset this effect. Reducing current vulnerability will be the first step to prepare for such anticipated changes.},

  abstract = {Climate may affect marine fish populations through many different pathways, operating at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Climate impacts may work their way bottom up through the food web or affect higher trophic levels more directly. In this review we try to disentangle and summarize some of the current knowledge made available through the rapidly increasing literature on the topic, with particular emphasis on the work within the Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC) programme. We first consider different classification schemes and hypotheses relating climate through physical features of the ocean to population patterns. The response of a population or community to climate may be linear or non-linear, direct or indirect. The hypotheses may be classified according to the form of physical features in operation as being related to mixing, advection or temperature. The bulk of the paper is devoted to a region-by-region presentation and discussion of examples relating climate variability to marine fish populations. It is slanted towards the North Atlantic and North Pacific, but the tropical Pacific is also covered. By means of different categorization methods we compare climate responses between ecosystems. We conclude that the use of such classification schemes allows for a more precise description of the various ecosystems particular properties and facilitates inter-regional comparison.},

In this study on the western Tropical Atlantic Ocean, it is shown that fresh surface waters of the Amazon River discharge may induce a strong halocline in the 3-30 m depth range. This halocline induces a pycnocline that acts as a barrier for mixing between the surface and the subsurface waters. The fresh surface waters are generally associated with positive anomalies of the sea surface temperature. These positive anomalies cover a large part of the basin in boreal summer-fall, following the maximum Amazon River discharge, which may have a significant importance for the ocean-atmosphere exchanges.},

This includes examining the characteristics of the diffuse scattering from a surface with heights that are still statistically dependent when decorrelated. Finally, we analyze the effect of correlation function on the scattering when the roughness is in the perturbation regime.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a model of the longwave atmospheric spectrum that improves in many respects widely used older models such as the microwave propagation model (MPM), since it is based on broadband measurements and calculations. According to our data, the model is fully applicable from 0 to 2 THz while including lines up to 10 THz. Its primary goal is to simulate the millimeter/submillimeter region accessible from the ground (frequencies up to ~2 THz at most, with a few windows between 1 and 2 THz accessible only under exceptional conditions at very dry sites). Line-by-line calculations of the absorption are performed using a line database generated from the latest available spectroscopic constants for all relevant atmospheric species. The collisional line widths are obtained from published laboratory data. The excess of absorption in the longwave range that cannot be explained by the line spectrum is modeled by introducing two different continuum-like terms based on FTS measurements between 170 and 1100 GHz: collision-induced absorption of the dry atmosphere due to transient dipoles in symmetric molecules (N 2 and O2) and continuum-like water vapor opacity. All H2O lines up to 10 THz are included in order to correctly account for the entire H2O far-wing opacity below 2 THz for a given line-shape. Hence, this contribution does not need to be part of a pseudocontinuum term below that frequency cutoff (still necessary, as shown in this paper) in contrast to other models used to date. Phase delays near H2O and O2 resonances are also important for ground-based astronomy since they affect interferometric phase. The frequency-dependent dispersive phase delay function is formally related to the absorption line shape via the Kramers-Kronig dispersion theory, and this relation has been used for modeling those delays. Precise calculations of phase delays are essential for the future Atacama large millimeter array (ALMA) project. A software package called atmospheric transmission at microwaves (ATM) has been developed to provide the radioastronomy and aeronomy communities with an updated tool to compute the atmospheric spectrum in clear-sky conditions for various scientific applications. We use this model to provide detailed simulations of atmospheric transmission and phase dispersion for several sites suitable for submillimeter astronomy},

All missions [Jason-1, ERS-2/ENVISAT, Topex/Poseidon interleaved with Jason-1 and Geosat Follow-On] are cross-calibrated previously to produce weekly gridded maps. In areas of intense variability, the rms differences between a classical configuration of two altimeters and the scenario merging four missions can reach 10 cm and 400 cm2/s2 in SLA and EKE, respectively, which represents an important percentage of the signal variance. A comparison with surface drifters shows that the four altimeter scenario improves the recovery of mesoscale structures that were not properly sampled with Jason-1 + ERS-2/ENVISAT. Finally, the consistency between altimetric and tide gauge data is improved by about 25% when coastal sea level is estimated with 4 satellites compared to the results obtained with 2 altimeters.},

The traditional considerations on the factors affecting the shape of the spectra are reviewed and compared to the results. In particular, the influence of large-scale synoptic systems is shown by comparing the steeper and more energetic spectra of the midlatitudes to the shallower spectra of the tropics. Similarly, the signature of convection is investigated by comparing spectra in the tropical convectively active and dry zones of the Pacific Ocean. Spectra of vorticity and divergence are calculated, along with spectral vorticity-to-divergence ratios. Their spatial and temporal variations are discussed. It is hypothesized that when convection is enhanced in the tropics, the spectral analysis captures the mesoscale/synoptic structures in which convection is embedded and that the spectra exhibit some of the characteristics of their midlatitude counterparts (i.e., steeper and more energetic).},

The aim of this project is collect some reprints of the most-significant original papers of the history of ray optics, from the seventeenth century (i.e., from the work by Rene Descartes) up to now. The purpose of the article is to show that the impedance-boundary condition (IBC)-usually referred both in western countries and in the former USSR as the Leontovich condition was also derived independently by another Russian scientist, A.N. Shchulkin. He published the IBC in 1940, in his book, Propagation of Radio Waves},

  abstract = {The Role of Averaging for Improving Sea Surface Salinity Retrieval from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Satellite and Impact of Auxiliary Data SABINE PHILIPPS, CHRISTINE BOONE, AND ESTELLE OBLIGIS CLS Space Oceanography Division, Ramonville St Agne, France (Manuscript received 28 October 2004, in final form 25 April 2006) ABSTRACT Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) was chosen as the European Space Agencyâs second Earth Explorer Opportunity mission. One of the objectives is to retrieve sea surface salinity (SSS) from measured brightness temperatures (TBs) at L band with a precision of 0.2 practical salinity units (psu) with averages taken over 200 km by 200 km areas and 10 days [as suggested in the requirements of the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE)]. The retrieval is performed here by an inverse model and additional information of auxiliary SSS, sea surface temperature (SST), and wind speed (W ). A sensitivity study is done to observe the influence of the TBs and auxiliary data on the SSS retrieval. The key role of TB and W accuracy on SSS retrieval is verified. Retrieval is then done over the Atlantic for two cases. In case A, auxiliary data are simulated from two model outputs by adding white noise. The more realistic case B uses independent databases for reference and auxiliary ocean parameters. For these cases, the RMS error of retrieved SSS on pixel scale is around 1 psu (1.2 for case B). Averaging over GODAE scales reduces the SSS error by a factor of 12 (4 for case B). The weaker error reduction in case B is most likely due to the correlation of errors in auxiliary data. This study shows that SSS retrieval will be very sensitive to errors on auxiliary data. Specific efforts should be devoted to improving the quality of auxiliary data. 1.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT A theory is developed to describe the properties of waves on the free surface of a liquid in turbulent motion. The distinction between the interacting wave and turbulent motions is achieved by separating the velocity field uniquely into a surface-induced contribution characteristic of the wave motion and a vorticity-induced contribution associated with the turbulence. The theory is applied to the scattering of gravity waves passing over the surface of deep water which has a turbulent motion of sufficiently low mean square vorticity. Expressions are derived for the directional distribution of the scattered wave (equation 4.19) and for the logarithmic decrement resulting from the scattering (4.20). It is shown that, under typical conditions in open sea, the attenuation from scattering will be greater than that from direct viscous dissipation for wavelengths greater than about 3 m.},

  Abstract                 = {An analytical method is described for predicting the bistatic normalized radar cross section of a rough homogeneous layer made up of a rough surface over a flat surface. The model is based on iteration of the Kirchhoff approximation to calculate the fields scattered by the rough layer, and is reduced to the high-frequency limit in order to obtain numerical results rapidly. The shadowing effect, significant for larger incidence or scattering angles, is taken into account through the use of shadowing functions. The model is applicable for moderate to large upper surface roughnesses having small to moderate slopes, and for both lossless and lossy inner media. It was validated for a two-dimensional problem (with 1D surfaces) in a preceding contribution. Here, the extension of the model to 2D surfaces is developed, and results are presented to validate the asymptotic model by comparison with a numerical reference method.},

  Abstract                 = {We report simultaneous microwave and acoustic Doppler backscattering measurements made in a wind-wave tank. The microwave system operated at 35 GHz (0.857 cm), while the acoustic system transmitted at 190 kHz (0.777 cm). The two systems were mounted to view the surface at the same incidence angle, which was varied. The measurements showed that when both systems looked upwind, horizontal transmit and receive polarization (HH) microwave backscatter from the rough water surface was 2 to 12 dB stronger than acoustic backscatter, depending on incidence angle and wind speed. When the acoustic system looked downwind, however, its backscattering level was consistently about 1 dB lower than that of the upward-looking microwave system. We interpret these results to indicate that both the acoustic and microwave systems were scattering from parasitic capillary waves in addition to freely propagating, wind-generated waves. The tilt of the parasitic capillary waves accounts for the observed differences in microwave and acoustic backscatter. We show that Bragg scattering theory predicts both the intensity and the Doppler shift of the microwave and acoustic signals very well using known properties of parasitic capillary waves. Spectral densities of the parasitic capillary waves derived from this Bragg scattering model are in good agreement with those predicted recently by Fedorov and Melville [1998] and observed by Fedorov et al. [1998].},

  Abstract                 = {{Singularity Analysis refers to the process of evaluating the local singularity exponent of a given signal at all points of its domain. The great potential of using singularity analysis for the description and understanding of multiscale systems have been repeatedly evidenced during the recent years. Simple algorithms for singularity analysis work well from the point of view of the statistical characterization of the system, but their quality, processing speed and overall performance are rather mediocre when more geometric, specific applications are envisaged. In this paper, we present a new algorithm which provides a fast characterization of singularity exponents acording to a central property observed in many multifractal systems: reconstructibility. Our singularity analysis scheme is based on a predictability measure, which provides information about the extent to which the signal at a given point can be reconstructed knowing its value over a neighborhood around that point. The singularity exponents so obtained attain very good spatial localization; more importantly, the most singular component associated to the obtaind exponents allow to reconstruct the signal to high accuracy.

  abstract = {The quality of the Ku-band scatterometer-derived winds is known to be degraded by the presence of rain. Little work has been done in characterizing the impact of rain on C-band scatterometer winds, such as those from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) onboard Metop-A. In this paper, the rain impact on the ASCAT operational level 2 quality control (QC) and retrieved winds is investigated using the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model winds, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) rain data, and tropical buoy wind and precipitation data as reference. In contrast to Ku-band, it is shown that C-band is much less affected by direct rain effects, such as ocean splash, but effects of increased wind variability appear to dominate ASCAT wind retrieval. ECMWF winds do not well resolve the airflow under rainy conditions. ASCAT winds do but also show artifacts in both the wind speed and wind direction distributions for high rain rates (RRs). The operational QC proves to be effective in screening these artifacts but at the expense of many valuable winds. An image-processing method, known as singularity analysis, is proposed in this paper to complement the current QC, and its potential is illustrated. QC at higher resolution is also expected to result in improved screening of high RRs.},

  Abstract                 = {The transfer of momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean is described in terms of the variation of wind speed with height and a drag coefficient that increases with sea surface roughness and wind speed. But direct measurements have only been available for weak winds; momentum transfer under extreme wind conditions has therefore been extrapolated from these field measurements. Global Positioning System sondes have been used since 1997 to measure the profiles of the strong winds in the marine boundary layer associated with tropical cyclones. Here we present an analysis of these data, which show a logarithmic increase in mean wind speed with height in the lowest 200 m, maximum wind speed at 500 m and a gradual weakening up to a height of 3 km. By determining surface stress, roughness length and neutral stability drag coefficient, we find that surface momentum flux levels off as the wind speeds increase above hurricane force. This behaviour is contrary to surface flux parameterizations that are currently used in a variety of modelling applications, including hurricane risk assessment and prediction of storm motion, intensity, waves and storm surges.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a recent undertaking in distributed numerical weather prediction via high data rate networks. The governing project involved the operation of a coupled mesoscale modeling system on widely separated supercomputers, and experiments and demonstrations were performed to explore both long-distance and local-area operation of the system. Connectivity was provided either by NASA's Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) or by a terrestrial Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network. The modeling system was built around the Fifth-Generation Pennsylvania State UniversityâNational Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (PSUâNCAR MM5) and consisted of the MM5, an ocean circulation model, and a surface wave model. The primary experiments and demonstrations utilized ACTS to link supercomputers at both NCAR in Boulder, Colorado, and at the Ohio Supercomputer Center in Columbus, Ohio. Other experiments and demonstrations utilized an ATM network to link supercomputers running the system at sites in Boulder. This paper focuses on the design and performance of the distributed numerical weather prediction system and its supporting networks. The project has demonstrated the feasibility of remote, distributed supercomputing, the potential for application of distributed computing principles and message-passing software to numerical modeling and coupled model construction, and means for creatively applying state-of-the-art networking technology to support meteorological modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {The upper ocean response to a moving hurricane is studied using historical air-sea data and a three-dimensional numerical ocean model. Sea surface temperature (SST) response is emphasized. The model has a surface mixed-layer (ML) that entrains according to a velocity dependent parameterization, and two lower layers that simulate the response in the thermocline. The passage of Hurricane Eloise (1975) over buoy EB-10 is simulated in detail. SST decreased 2Â°C as Eloise passed directly over EB-10 at 8.5 m sâ1. Model results indicate that entrainment caused 85% of the irreversible heat flux into the ML; air-sea heat exchange accounted for the remainder. The maximum SST response was predicted to be â3Â°C and to occur 60 km to the right of the hurricane track. This is consistent with the well-documented rightward bias in the SST response to rapidly moving hurricanes. The rightward bias occurs in the model solution because the hurricane wind-stress vector turns clockwise with time on the right side of the track and is roughly resonant with the ML velocity. High ML velocities cause strong entrainment and thus a strong SST response. Model comparisons with EB-10 data suggest that a wind-speed-dependent drag coefficient similar to Garratt's (1977) is appropriate for hurricane conditions. A constant drag coefficient 1.5 Ã 10â3 underpredicts the amplitude of upwelling and the SST response by â¼40%. Numerical experiments show that the response has a lively dependence on a number of air-sea parameters. Intense, slowly moving hurricanes cause the largest response. The SST response is largest where cold water is near the sea surface, i.e., where the initial ML is thin and the upper thermocline temperature gradient is sharp. Nonlocal processes are important to some aspects of the upper ocean response. Upwelling significantly enhances entrainment under slowly moving hurricanes (â²4 m sâ1) and reduces the rightward bias of the SST response. Horizontal advection dominates the pointwise ML heat balance during the several-day period following a hurricane passage. Pressure gradients set up by the upwelling do not play an important role in the entrainment process, but are an effective mechanism for dispersing energy from the ML over a 5â10 day time scale.},

  Abstract                 = {The two-scale electromagnetic model is a well-established theory for simulating microwave polarimetric passive observations of a sea surface. A critical aspect is the long computational time that is required to run the forward model, which hampers the creation of large training databases or iterative simulations within retrieval algorithms. To tackle this problem, a neural network (NN) technique is proposed in this paper. In particular, we have adopted NNs to emulate a simulator named SEAWIND, which implements the two-scale model and was validated in previous works. Two training algorithms, including a regularized approach, have been considered and compared. The assessment of the proposed approach has been carried out by statistically comparing neural-network-derived simulations with SEAWIND-derived ones for two validation data sets comprising different climatic conditions, as well as by computing the azimuthal Fourier harmonic coefficients versus wind speed and atmospheric transmittance. Regressive model functions have also been used as benchmarks. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of an NN approach to efficient and effective modeling of sea-surface thermal emission and scattering.},

  Abstract                 = {Two kinds of Bayesian-based cost functions ( i.e. , the unconstrained cost function and parameter-constrained cost function) are investigated for retrieving the sea surface salinity (SSS). In low SSS regions, we have analyzed the sensitivity of the two cost functions to geophysical parameters. The results show that the unconstrained cost function is valid for retrieving several parameters (including SSS, wind speed and significant wave height), and the constrained cost function, which largely depends on the accuracy of reference values, may lead to large retrieval biases. Furthermore, as a retrieval parameter, the sea surface temperature (SST) can result in the divergence of other geophysical parameters in an unconstrained cost function due to the strong sensitivity of brightness temperature to SST. By using the unconstrained cost function and the simulated brightness temperature T B with white noises, the retrieval biases of SSS are discussed with the following two procedures. Procedure a): the simulated T B values are first averaged, and then SSS is retrieved. Procedure b): the SSS is directly retrieved from the simulated T B , and then the retrieved SSS values are averaged. The results indicate that, for low SSS and SST distributions, the SSS retrieval by procedure a) has less biases compared with that by procedure b), while the two procedures give almost the same retrieval results for high SSS and SST sea regions.},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigates the sea surface salinity (SSS) and barrier layer variability in the equatorial Pacific using recently available Aquarius and Argo data. Comparison between the two data sets indicates that Aquarius is able to capture most of the SSS features identified by Argo. Despite some discrepancies in the mean value, the SSS from the two data sets shows essentially the same seasonal cycle in both magnitude and phase. For the period of observation between August 2011 and July 2013 Aquarius nicely resolved the zonal displacement of the SSS front along the equator, showing its observing capacity of the western Pacific warm pool. Analysis of the Argo data provides further information on surface stratification. A thick barrier layer is present on the western side of the SSS front during all the period of observation, moving back and forth along the equator with its correlation with the Southern Oscillation Index exceeding 0.80. Generally, the thick barrier layer moves eastward during El NiÃ±o and westward during La NiÃ±a. The mechanisms responsible for this zonal displacement are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The physics of remote sensing sea surface measurements is still poorly understood under severe weather conditions. Wind vector algorithms are usually developed for non-precipitating atmospheres and for wind speeds less than 20 m/s. In this study, we analyze observations from the QuikSCAT Ku-band scatterometer collocated with the WindSat full polarimetric microwave radiometer to estimate the potential of these two instruments for sea surface wind retrieval under severe weather conditions. The Jason altimeter provides independent measurements of wind speed and rain rate for comparison purposes. The sensitivity of the radar cross-sections and brightness temperatures to the wind speed and direction is directly studied from the observations and compared with semi empirical models. This study clearly demonstrates that wind vector retrieval under extreme condition is feasible. Comparisons between QuikSCAT and WindSat coincident observations evidence a better sensitivity of the active mode to low and moderate winds and more sensitivity to high wind speeds in the passive mode. Although the WindSat observations are affected by water vapor, cloud, and rain, especially at and above 18 GHz, the measurements are sensitive to wind speed even at high wind speeds. Contrarily to the active instrument, there is no saturation at high winds. The sensitivity clearly tends to increase for winds above 15 m/s. For the wind direction, the amplitude of the azimuthal modulation in the active mode decreases with increasing wind speed, while it increases for the passive measurements. The development of specific wind retrievals under severe weather conditions is encouraged and a simple illustration is provided.},

Drift and mixing are also functions of the surface Stokes drift Uss, volume Stokes transport TS, a wave breaking height scale Hswg, and the flux of energy from waves to ocean turbulence Î¦oc. Here we describe a global database of these parameters, estimated from a well-validated numerical wave model, that uses traditional forms of the wave generation and dissipation parameterizations, and covers the years 2003--2007. Compared to previous studies, the present work has the advantage of being consistent with the known physical processes that regulate the wave field and the air--sea fluxes, and also consistent with a very large number of in situ and satellite observations of wave parameters. Consequently, some of our estimates differ significantly from previous estimates. In particular, we find that the mean global integral of Î¦oc is 68 TW, and the yearly mean value of TS is typically 10--30{\%} of the Ekman transport, except in well-defined regions where it can reach 60{\%}. We also have refined our previous estimates of Uss by using a better treatment of the high frequency part of the wave spectrum.

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the turbulence induced by wave-breaking at the ocean surface. Two recent models use a mechanism of direct depth injection of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) by breaking waves. Those models aim to reproduce the near-surface mean and turbulent properties, in particular the TKE dissipation rates. Of critical importance are the injection depth of each breaking wave and the size distribution of those breaking waves. The models by Sullivan et al. (2007) and by Kudryavtsev et al. (2008) have very different parameterizations, and those differences are reviewed here and compared to available observations. Using realistic parameterizations in these models leads to TKE injections too shallow to compare to observations, in particular for developed seas. The near-surface turbulence is thus still not well understood to the zeroth order. For instance, whether developed seas produce deeper or shallower mixing than young seas is neither well understood nor well modelled. Additional dedicated measurements as well as investigations of breaking non-breaking wave interactions are needed.},

Daily Level 3 product on a 0.25\B0 x\97 0.25\B0 grid for the year 2010 has been used for this assessment in the Indian Ocean. Various data sets, like the in situ data sets available from the Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA) buoys and Argo floats and also the data sets from modular ocean model version 3 simulations, have been utilized for this purpose. Comparison made at two buoy locations suggests good quality of SMOS SSS with root-mean-square error of the order of 0.36 and 0.34 psu. The triple collocation method, which explicitly takes into account the error characteristics of the SMOS, Argo, and model data sets, has been used for further validation of the SMOS data. Since the Indian Ocean exhibits characteristically different patterns of SSS in its different subregions, the study area has been divided into different such subregions. The SMOS-derived SSS appears to be of very good quality in the equatorial Indian Ocean and southern Indian Ocean, while the data are of poorer quality in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal possibly because of the errors in SSS retrieval due to the land contamination and strong winds.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the Met Office Hadley Centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature (SST) data set, HadISST1, and the nighttime marine air temperature (NMAT) data set, HadMAT1. HadISST1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (GISST) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of SST and sea ice concentration on a 1Â° latitude-longitude grid from 1871. The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5Â° latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets.},

The seasonal cycle of the mixed layer salinity is driven by seasonality in E-P, Ekman advection, entrainment, and sea ice. Over large areas, the geostrophic advection and diffusion show smaller contributions to the seasonal variation relative to other terms. The air-sea freshwater flux and Ekman advection in this area generally result in net decreases in salinity, while the entrainment term yields increases. Residual imbalance is consistent with a sea ice effect, whose contribution is evaluated. Sea ice is found to make a significant contribution, growing in importance toward the ice edge.},

  Abstract                 = {Mesoscale eddies are present everywhere in the ocean and partly determine the mean state of the circulation and ecosystem. The current feedback on the surface wind stress modulates the air-sea transfer of momentum by providing a sink of mesoscale eddy energy as an atmospheric source. Using nine years of satellite measurements of surface stress and geostrophic currents over the global ocean, we confirm that the current-induced surface stress curl is linearly related to the current vorticity. The resulting coupling coefficient between current and surface stress (sÏ{$[$}N s mâ3{$]$}) is heterogeneous and can be roughly expressed as a linear function of the mean surface wind. sÏexpresses the sink of eddy energy induced by the current feedback. This has important implications for air-sea interaction and implies that oceanic mean and mesoscale circulations and their effects on surface-layer ventilation and carbon uptake are better represented in oceanic models that include this feedback.},

  Abstract                 = {Microwave Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) measurements can be performed by isolating the emissivity response to salinity changes from numerous geophysical effects, including surface temperature and wind waves. At L-band frequencies (1 to 2 GHz), the sensitivity to SSS is sufficient but it falls off quickly as frequency is increased. Nevertheless, methods using higher microwave frequencies with much lower SSS sensitivity than at L band, can already be tested. In particular, combining 6 and 10 GHz data in vertical polarization efficiently minimizes sea surface roughness and thermal impacts. Using AMSR-E data, the retrieved bi-monthly maps of SSS at 0.5Â° resolution over the region of the Amazon plume show relative accuracy in-line with the future L-band dedicated mission objectives.},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-angular images of the brightness temperature $(T_{rm B})$ of the Earth at 1.4 GHz are reconstructed from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite sensor data since end 2009. Sea surface salinity (SSS) products remote sensing from space is being attempted using these data over the world oceans. The quality of the first version of the European Space Agency operational Level 2 (L2) SSS swath products is assessed in this paper, using satellite/in situ SSS data match-ups that were collected over the second half of 2010. This database reveals that 95% of the SMOS L2 products show a global error standard deviation on the order of $ sim$1.3 practical salinity scale. Simple spatiotemporal aggregation of the L2 products to generate monthly SSS maps at $1^{circ} times 1^{circ}$ spatial resolution reduces the error down to about 0.6 globally and 0.4 in the tropics for 90% of the data. Several major problems are, however, detected in the products. Systematically, SMOS SSS data are biased within a $sim$1500 km wide belt along the world coasts and sea ice edges, with a contamination intensity and spread varying from ascending to descending passes. Numerous world ocean areas are permanently or intermittently contaminated by radio-frequency interferences, particularly in the northern high latitudes and following Asia coastlines. Moreover, temporal drifts in the retrieved SSS fields are found with varying signatures in ascending and descending passes. In descending passes, a time-dependent strong latitudinal bias is found, with maximum amplitude reached at the end of the year. Errors in the forward modeling of the wind-induced emissivity and of the sea surface scattered galactic sources are as well- identified, biasing the sss retrievals at high and low winds and when the galactic equator sources are reflected toward the sensor.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of rain on sea surface temperature, salinity and density is examined using data of surface drifters in regions of the tropical oceans with large rainfall. In a few off-equatorial areas, there are sufficient drifter data to composite average daily cycles. There, the period of the day with largest salinity changes is associated with the largest rainfall rates and the lowest salinity. For a one-yearlong trajectory in the southwest Pacific, this results in an early morning salinity minimum, whereas the opposite is found close to equatorial West Africa. We then consider individual freshening events larger than 0.1 psu (averaging 0.56 psu at 50 cm), and find that they are often related with local rainfall, are associated with a surface cooling, and relax in a time inversely proportional to wind intensity. The temperature cooling is dependent on the time of day, but the freshening presents less daily cycle and the largest fast changes in salinity tend to be associated with the largest rainfall rates. When two measurement levels are available, the initial salinity signal is larger by more than 20% at the shallow depth (15 cm) compared with the deeper measurement level (near 50 cm), and the temperature and salinity gradients between the two levels are proportional (0.22$\,^{\circ}$C for a 1% dilution).},

  Abstract                 = {Close to 1800 surface drifters are used to investigate the 15 m circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean. The data are used to describe structures of the average Eulerian circulation and of the associated eddy variability. The data resolve scales on the order of 50 km, which have hitherto not been systematically described, in particular, near shelf breaks and near the most intense currents, the Gulf Stream, the North Atlantic Current (NAC), and the frontal currents of the subpolar gyre. This reveals a complex series of quasi-permanent eddies, meanders, and recirculation patterns. Gulf Stream intensity is portrayed as changing abruptly near 54Â°W, east of which, it is identified as two current branches centered near 39Â° and 41.5Â°N, the northern one connecting more directly with the NAC, and the southern one with the recirculation gyre and the Azores Current (AC). Many features of the currents are controlled by topography, in particular, currents are often intensified near shelf breaks or parallel to ridges in the subpolar gyre. However, the largest northward branch of the NAC in the Icelandic basin is located near the deepest bathymetry, not near steep bathymetry. Other currents, in particular, in the subtropical gyre, are less clearly related to topography: for instance, the AC is featured as a zonal eastward current extending far west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) to at least 55Â°W and possibly 63Â°W. In the interior and away from topographic features the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is the largest where the mean currents are the largest. In the subpolar gyre, there are striking differences in EKE between southward flowing currents (the Labrador and east Greenland Current) and the northward flowing currents (west Greenland Current and branches of the NAC), which have higher EKE. The areas of weakest variability are located in the southwest part of the subpolar gyre, northeast of Iceland, and in the eastern Atlantic south of 45Â°N. The AC eddies and the mesoscales south of the Canary Islands transect this eastern eddy desert. Drifter trajectories are used as realizations of Lagrangian particles in the vicinity of current cores. These illustrate the variety of paths or connections between different current systems and demonstrate cross-stream dispersions.},

  abstract = {Abstract During the second Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study (SPURS-2) 2017 tropical Pacific cruise, two drifters were deployed on 9 November. The drifters measured temperature and salinity in the top 36 cm, wave spectra, and the noise of rain drops. During a short nearly circular survey with a 1.8-km radius around the drifters, the R/V Revelle measured air-sea fluxes, as well as temperature and salinity stratification in the top 1 m from a towed surface salinity profiler (SSP). A C-band weather radar measuring rain rate within 1- to 100-km range of the ship observed discrete rain cells organized in a system moving from the southeast to the northwest. Some of the intense rain cells were small scale (1 km in diameter or less) with short lifetimes yet dropped more than 5 cm of water in half an hour near the drifters, whereas the ship measured short rain episodes totaling 1.3 cm of rainfall mostly accompanied by very low wind. The data indicate a large spatial heterogeneity in temperature and salinity, with near-surface freshening of up to 9 psu measured at different times by the two drifters (separated by less than 500 m) and by the SSP. The drifters indicate deepening of the fresh and cool surface layer during the rain which then thinned during the following 40 min with very low wind speed (<2 m/s). Patchy surface-trapped cold and fresh layers were also observed by the SSP east of the drifters. The high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall and surface-trapped fresh pools is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {One hundred ten satellite-tracked freely drifting buoys measured velocities and trajectories of the near-surface currents in the North Atlantic. Mean velocity values and the velocity variance about the mean were calculated for different regions. A horizontal map of eddy kinetic energy was prepared on a 2Â°Ã2Â° grid between latitudes 20Â° and 55Â°N. Maximum eddy energy (â¼3000 cm2 sâ2) coincides with the high speed Gulf Stream jet where it begins large amplitude meanders near 37Â°N 67Â°W. A tongue of high eddy energy coincides with the Stream's path eastward and around the Grand Banks into the Newfoundland Basin where values of 1000 cm2 sâ2 are found. A weaker tongue extends eastward across the mid-Atlantic Ridge near 45Â°N. A second weak extension reaches southeastward from the Stream and crosses the mid-Atlantic Ridge between 30Â° and 35Â°N. North and south of the Stream, eddy energy diminishes rapidly reaching an e folding at 300 km from the axis. Values of 200 cm2 sâ2 were observed in the mid-gyre region and 100 cm2 sâ2 in the Eastern North Atlantic and North Equatorial Current. Although the gross distribution of eddy energy is similar to that determined from ship drift measurements, there are significant differences. Eddy energy from drifters amounts to about twice the value measured by ship drift in the Gulf Stream and one half the ship drift values in the mid-gyre. It is suggested that these differences are due to the horizontal averaging of mesoscale motion and the errors in navigation, both of which are problems with the ship drift technique.},

Twelve rings were identified; nine were cyclonic (cold core) rings and three were anticyclonic (warm core) rings. This is the largest number of rings ever observed during a short period of time (4months). Evidence suggests that the mean movement of these rings was southwestward.},

  Abstract                 = {A cyclonic Gulf Stream ring, Allen, was followed over its life from September 1976 to April 1977 in the region north of Bermuda. Conductivity, temperature, and depth; expendable bathythermograph; and velocity profile measurements were made in Allen, and over the last 5 months of its life, satellite buoys were used to track continuously its movement. The measurements indicate that in December 1976 Allen split into two rings, a large one, Allen, and a small one, Arthur. Arthur moved rapidly eastward and coalesced with the Gulf Stream near the New England seamounts. Allen moved in a large clockwise loop; at the end of February 1977 it became attached to the Gulf Stream and reformed into a modified ring, smaller in size and faster in rotation. At the end of April 1977 the modified ring coalesced with the Gulf Stream and disappeared as it was advected downstream in the stream. The principal results of this study are that (1) the New England Seamount chain was a major influence in the genesis of Allen and on the trajectories of nearby rings; (2) while a free eddy, months after its formation, Allen evolved into a bi modal or peanut-shaped structure; (3) the bimodal structure ultimately bifurcated, spawning a new isolated eddy, denoted as Arthur, and a modified remnant, Allen; (4) the velocity field of Allen involved the whole water column, with bottom velocities of 10â15 cm sâ1; (5) the barotropic velocity at the center of Allen (6 cm sâ1 to NNW) was about equal to its translation velocity (4 cm sâ1 to NW); (6) especially energetic inertial motions were seen at the center of Allen, and these may play a role in enhancing the stirring of water properties; (7) Allen survived several close encounters or entrainments with the Gulf Stream, proving that such encounters can be nonfatal to a ring; (8) the encounters appear to result in injections (exchanges) of water (momentum, heat, etc.) into the rings at an estimate rate of 106 m3 sâ1 per ring; and (9) the behavior of Allen and Arthur was in contrast to the results of some other studies which have shown that rings generally drift slowly and passively southwestward.},

  Abstract                 = {Electromagnetic waves traveling through the ionosphere undergo a Faraday rotation of the polarization vector, which modifies the polarization and phase characteristics of the electromagnetic signal. Using L-band ( lambda;=24 cm), polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the shuttle imaging radar C (SIR-C) acquired in 1994, the author simulates the effect of a change in the Faraday rotation angle psi; on spaceborne interferometric and polarimetric data. In one experiment, it was found that phase coherence is reduced by up to 33% when psi; changes between successive data acquisitions. If psi; changes by more than 40 deg;, a differential phase signal, which varies from field to field, appears in the interferogram and impairs the mapping of surface topography and/or the detection of ground deformation. This signal is caused by phase differences between horizontal-polarized and vertical-polarized radar signals from intermediate levels of vegetation canopy, similar to the phase difference measured between H-polarized and V-polarized signals on a single date. In a second experiment, data from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) L-band radar acquired in an area of active deforestation in Rondonia, Brazil, are compared with SIR-C L-band polarimetric data acquired at the same incidence, two weeks later, but from a lower orbiting altitude. Large differences in scattering behavior are recorded between the two datasets in the areas of slash and burn forest, which are difficult to reconcile with surface changes. A simulation with SIR-C polarimetric data, however, suggests that those differences are consistent with a Faraday rotation angle of about 30 plusmn;10 deg; in the JERS-1 data and 0 deg; in the SIR-C data. Based on these two experiments and on Global Positioning System (GPS) records of ionospheric activity, it is concluded that Faraday rotation should not affect the analysis of L-band spaceborne data during periods of low ionospheric activity (solar minima)},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of a non-Gaussian ocean on satellite altimetry parameter estimation are discussed. The first part of this paper shows how non-Gaussian ocean parameters affect height estimation for satellites of the Seasat/Geosat/TOPEX type. In the second part, the estimation of the altimeter tracker bias and the non-Gaussian ocean parameters from the altimeter return signal is studied. A new convolution model that facilitates the deconvolution of the ocean surface specular point probability density function is introduced. Next, it is argued that it is not feasible in practice to estimate the electromagnetic bias from noisy altimeter returns. It is then shown that the least squares estimation of the surface parameters in the log-frequency domain has several advantages over estimating parameters in the time domain. The maximum likelihood estimation equations for the estimation of the waveform parameters are derived, and their solution is discussed.},

Based on anomalies in dynamic height, 410 eddies are identified in 30 transects from 1991 to 1999, including eddies seen in multiple transects over a year or longer. Their wavelength is typically 500 km, with peak-to-trough temperature difference of 2.2\B0C in the center of the thermocline.

In the mean, 3.9 Sv (Sv  106 m3 s\88\921) of thermocline waters are carried southward by the eddy field over the width of the basin, balanced mainly by northward flow in the surface layer. Corresponding northward heat transport is 0.086 \B1 0.012 pW. The eddy field has considerable variability on seasonal to interannual timescales.

The role of the seasonal cycle of the Amazon freshwater discharge for the evolution of the barrier layer (BL) in the western tropical Atlantic and on the freshwater budget is estimated. During the experiments, three different runoff fields are being applied, including a time-mean runoff, a seasonally varying runoff, and one that results from the GECCO assimilation approach. The simulation forced with a seasonal Amazon discharge appears to be closer to the constrained solution and moves away from the run with a constant runoff, demonstrating that the seasonal variability of the Amazon is an essential contributor in the freshwater forcing of the western tropical Atlantic. The modeled time-mean BL thickness seems to be overestimated by the model relative to the data. On the seasonal timescale, the simulated spatial mean BL is found to vary between 13 and 30 m, with a maximum occurring in July, following the Amazon high discharge period in May. Analyzing the freshwater content balance, we find integrated near-surface freshwater import from the western tropical Atlantic interior of around 0.20 Sv in October-November at 38\B0W and cumulative freshwater export out of the domain with a maximum of around 0.4 Sv in June as an effect of the Amazon flood in May.},

  Abstract                 = {Satellite-based repeat-pass Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) provides a synoptic high spatial resolution perspective of Earth's changing surface, permitting one to view large areas quickly and efficiently. By measuring relative phase change from one observation to the next on a pixel-by-pixel basis, maps of deformation and change can be derived. Variability of the atmosphere and the ionosphere leads to phase/time delays that are present in the data that can mask many of the subtle deformation signatures of interest, so methods for mitigation of these effects are important. Many of these effects have been observed in existing ALOS PALSAR data, and studies are underway to characterize and mitigate the ionosphere using these data. Since the ionosphere is a dispersive medium, it is possible in principle distinguish the ionospheric signatures from the non-dispersive effects of deformation and the atmosphere. In this paper, we describe a method for mapping the ionosphere in InSAR data based on a multi-frequency split-spectrum processing technique. We examine a number of PALSAR data sets, including fully polarimetric and single-polarization 28 MHz bandwidth data, where anomalous effects in phase, amplitude and image registration have been observed. We demonstrate the estimation of the ionosphere by means of the split spectrum technique for estimating differential TEC, whereby a radar waveform is transmitted over the full PALSAR spectral band and widely separated portions of the receive spectrum are processed independently and compared for dispersive effects, and quantify its performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Reflection of a vertically polarized electromagnetic plane wave from a periodic rough surface is considered. The surface is characterized locally by a boundary impedance. By using a perturbation analysis, a general expression is obtained for the amplitudes of the scattered waves which is valid for all spectral and all perturbation orders. It is shown that the results obtained here are consistent with earlier analyses of Rice, Wait, and Barrick. In addition, the general expression permits one to discern some important properties of the amplitudes for a purely sinusoidal surface. Among other things, we show that all odd perturbation orders are zero for the specular mode.},

Wave profiles obtained with the laser system have been analyzed and show that wave growth occurs simultaneously at all frequencies and that an equilibrium value for the higher frequency components is eventually reached, but not before substantially higher (overshoot) values are obtained. Simultaneous observations of the microwave brightness temperature at vertical incidence show an increase with wind speed (or roughness of the sea surface) of 1Â°K/m/s. This increase, not in accord with theory, is shown to be a function of the percentage of foam coverage of the ocean surface.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to clarify the link between ocean salt content (OSC) conservation and the freshwater flux formulation in ocean general circulation models (OGCMs), a varying level thickness, nonlinear free surface version of the OPA is presented. Linear/nonlinear free surface equations are solved using an original approach based on an explicit damping of fast external gravity waves. The method leaves both the potential vorticity equation and the equilibrium state unchanged. Its numerics and cost are quite similar to those of implicit schemes. When nonlinearities are kept, a variable first level thickness is required. Its discretization is determined by volume and energy constraints. The OSC conservation depends on the surface kinematic equation used. Four formulations are presented: (1) virtual salt flux (fixed ocean volume and no volume flux), (2) natural (fixed ocean volume and volume flux), (3) linear free surface (fixed volume and volume flux computed from a linear free surface equation), and (4) assumption free (variable volume computed from a nonlinear free surface equation). Their impact is illustrated in 25 year lowâresolution global OGCM simulations. In all cases the firstâorder ocean response is quite similar, as the concentrationâdilution effect always exists. Formulations 4 and 2 ensure a strict conservation of the OSC. Nevertheless, the difference in formulation 3 is not strong enough to play a significant role: the conservation is almost perfect. Only formulation 1 neglects fresh waterâdriven surface pumping. This mainly modifies the sea surface salinity of the ocean basin where river runoffs are strong. No significant difference is found between the other formulations as a large time step dampens highâfrequency free surface motion. The best compromise for climate is the linear free surface formulation. It allows a nearly exact OSC conservation, introduces the fresh waterâdriven pumping, and runs faster than all the other formulations.},

  Abstract                 = {The sampling characteristics of an underwater glider are addressed through comparison with contemporaneous measurements from a ship survey using a towed vehicle. The comparison uses the underwater glider Spray and the towed vehicle SeaSoar north of Hawaii along 158Â°W between 22.75Â°N and 34.5Â°N. A Spray dive from the surface to 1000 m and back took 5.6 h and covered 5.3 km, resulting in a horizontal speed of 0.26 m sâ1. SeaSoar undulated between the surface and 400 m, completing a cycle in 11 min while covering 2.6 km, for a speed of 3.9 m sâ1. Adjacent profiles of temperature and salinity are compared between the two platforms to prove that each is accurate. Spray and SeaSoar data are compared through sections, isopycnal spatial series, and wave number spectra. The relative slowness of the glider results in the projection of high-frequency oceanic variability, such as internal waves, onto spatial structure. The projection is caused by Doppler smearing because of finite speed and aliasing due to discrete sampling. The projected variability is apparent in properties measured on depth surfaces or in isopycnal depth. No projected variability is seen in observations of properties on constant density surfaces because internal waves are intrinsically filtered. Wave number spectra suggest that projected variability affects properties at constant depth at wavelengths shorter than 30 km. These results imply that isobaric quantities, like geostrophic shear, are valid at wavelengths longer than 30 km, while isopycnal quantities, like spice, may be analyzed for scales as small as a glider measures.},

A baseline T-S diagram is arranged from climatology data, differentiating 7 ocean zones and mapping them into the T-S domain.

  Abstract                 = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission will provide sea surface salinity maps over the oceans, beginning in late 2009. In this paper an ocean salinity error budget is described, an analysis needed to identify the magnitude of the error sources associated with the retrieval. Instrumental, external noise sources, and geophysical errors have been analyzed, stressing their relative impact. This paper includes results from previous studies, addressing the impact of multisource auxiliary sea surface temperature and wind speed data on the final salinity error. It provides, moreover, a sensitivity analysis to the uncertainty of the auxiliary salinity field. Salinity retrieval has been addressed in a wide set of configurations of the inversion algorithm.},

The key objectives at the base of this study are: 1) To demonstrate the feasibility of generating routinely satellite-derived surface T-S diagrams, obviating the lack of extensive sampling of the surface open ocean; 2) To display the T-S diagrams variability and the distribution/dynamics of SSS, altogether with SST and the relative density with respect to in-situ measurements, and 3) To assess the SMOS SSS data added value in detecting geophysical signals not sensed/resolved by the Argo measurements. To perform the latter analysis, the satellite-Argo mismatches have been overlapped with geophysical parameters of precipitation rates, surface heat and freshwater fluxes and wind speed data. Ongoing and future efforts focus on enlarging the study area and the temporal frame of the analysis and aim at developing a method for the systematic identification of surface water masses formation areas by remotely-sensed data.},

  abstract = {In a first part, this paper describes radar experiments aimed at probing the sea surface from the coast. To capture small-scale changes in a coastal environment, a flexible high resolution, Doppler L-band radar with high resolution in range has been used. The data exhibit significant sensitivity to current and wind, which justifies the development of a model for inversion. The second part of the paper is thus devoted to our first attempt to model radar echoes, in order to accurately describe the influence of the geophysical parameters of interest. Here, the focus is put on waves generated by a local wind. The key point consists in taking properly into account non-linear hydrodynamic interactions between waves to generate a realistic moving sea surface. From the electromagnetic point of view, since standard low-frequency approximations no longer hold at L-band, a small-slope approximation has been implemented to compute the backscattered field. Numerical results show that for light winds (less than 5 mâsâ1) the model correctly predicts the behaviour of the data with respect to wind speed and direction. To cite this article: M.

Numerical results show the influence of the statistical parameters of the asperities on the absorption phenomena for metallic surfaces. Then the influence of asperities on the total transmission around Brewster incidence is studied.

The simulated moisture fields show remarkable success in duplicating the large-scale structure and seasonal features in the observations, but they show insufficient contrast between very dry and very moist regions. The simulation generally does well in northern summer (JuneâJulyâAugust) but worse in northern winter. This is consistent with deficiencies in the annual cycle of moist convection so that convective rain stays too close to the equator in northern winter. The related misplacement of convective activity associated with the Asian monsoon produces discrepancies in the moisture over much of the Eastern Hemisphere. The simulation also shows a too weak moisture response to interannual fluctuations in the sea surface temperature, even for the large El NiÃ±o episode of 1983. These results indicate that deficiencies in modeling oceanic convection may be in part responsible for errors in the simulated upper-tropospheric moisture patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the advances in imaging and storage technologies, the number and size of images continue to grow at a rapid pace. This problem is particularly acute in the case of remotely sensed imagery. The continuous stream of sensory data from satellites poses major challenges in storage and retrieval of the satellite imagery. In the mean time, the ubiquity of Internet has resulted into an ever-growing population of users searching for various forms of information. In this paper, we describe the search engine SIMR--Satellite Image Matching and Retrieval system. SIMR provides an efficient means to match remotely sensed imagery. It computes spectral and spatial attributes of the images using a hierarchical representation. A unique aspect of our approach is the coupling of second-level spatial autocorrelation with quad tree structure. The efficiency of the web-based SIMR has been evaluated using a database of images with known characteristics: cities, towns, airports, lakes, and mountains. Results show that the integrated signature can be an effective basis for accurately searching databases of satellite based imagery.},

Radiative properties for various surface geometries are calculated. Since the integral method is computationally expensive, a geometric optics approximation is developed. The regions of validity of the approximation compared with the integral method are quantified. Curves are presented that show these radiative properties versus the correlation length at incidence angle for a fixed rms deviation of the surface. The surface geometry, incidence angle, multiple scattering, shadowing effects, and dielectric permittivity contributions to the domains of validity of the approximation method are discussed for both TE and TM polarizations.},

  Abstract                 = {Sea surface height anomalies from satellite altimeter data are used to estimate heat storage. Since variability in sea surface height is mostly due to expansion and contraction of the water column it can be correlated with variations in the heat and salt content. Therefore, estimation of heat storage from altimeter data, when compared to in situ estimates, requires corrections for the haline effect. Three sites with a nearly continuous time series of temperature and salinity profiles simultaneous with TOPEX/POSEIDON data are studied: HOT, CalCOFI and Hydrostation ``S''. Haline corrections based on in situ and climatological salinity measurements are contrasted. For the studied regions, the haline corrections based on climatology provide equivalent or worse results than not applying a correction at all. The use of in situ salinity estimates decreased the differences between the heat storage estimates (up to 17 Ã 107 J mâ2) and significantly improved their correlation (up to 0.18).},

  Abstract                 = {The detection of long-term trends in geophysical time series is a key issue in climate change studies. This detection is affected by many factors: the size of the trend to be detected, the length of the available data sets, and the noise properties. Although the noise autocorrelation observed in geophysical time series does not bias the trend estimate, it affects the estimation of its uncertainty and consequently the ability to detect, or not, a significant trend. Ignoring the noise autocorrelation level typically leads to an overdetection of significant trends. Due to satellite lifetime, usually between 5 and 10 years, sea surface time series do not cover the same period and are acquired by different sensors with different characteristics. These differences lead to unknown level shifts (biases) between the data sets, which affect the trend detection. In this work, we develop a generic framework to detect and evaluate linear trends and level shifts in multisensor time series of satellite chlorophyll-a concentrations, as provided by the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer instrument (MERIS) and sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean-color missions. We also discuss the optimization of the observation networks, in terms of needed time overlap between successive time series to reduce the uncertainty on the detection of long-term trends. For the incoming Sentinel 3-Ocean and Land Color Instrument (3-OLCI) mission that should be launched at the end of 2014, we propose a global map of the number of months of observations to enhance the trend detection performed with the joint SeaWiFS-MERIS analysis.},

In the same area and period (October to December, 1968) 60 days of current records were obtained at six depths from the surface down to 2000 m; they show that the meander and eddy circulations are confined to the upper 1000 m and are weak with surface currents of only 30â75 cm/sec. The energy of the eddy is shown to reside principally in the form of available potential energy, which is present in the local deformation of the density field and estimated to be 1023 ergs; this quantity is 30 times larger than the total kinetic energy of the circulation (3Ã1021 ergs). Estimates are made of the rate of destruction of the total energy of the eddy by (i) enhanced heat loss to the atmosphere and (ii) dissipation of kinetic energy by turbulent vertical diffusion: the eddy lifetime from these processes is estimated as 6 months and 1 year respectively.},

A theory for the maximum possible reduction of the SST directly under the eye of a tropical cyclone is proposed and tested against model data. It implies a much higher sensitivity of tropical cyclone intensity to the SST under the eye of the storm than to the large-scale SST field. It therefore suggests a much higher importance of the SST feedback effect on the intensity of tropical cyclones than has previously been thought},

  Abstract                 = {Rainfall over the sea modifies the molecular boundary layers of the upper ocean through a variety of different effects. These cover the freshwater flux stabilizing the near-surface layer, additional heat flux established due to rain versus surface temperature differences, modification of physical parameters by temperature and salinity changes, enhancement of the surface roughness, damping of short gravity waves, surface mixing by rain, and transfer of additional momentum from air to sea. They are separately described and included in our surface renewal model to investigate the rain's influence on the cool skin of the ocean and the creation of a haline molecular diffusion layer. Simulations with the upgraded model show that the most important effect on the conductive layer is that of reduced renewal periods followed by additional surface cooling due to rain on the order of 0.1 K. At rain rates below 50 mm h-1 rainfall is not able to completely destroy the mean temperature difference across the cool skin. A freshwater skin is created that exhibits a salinity difference exceeding 4â° under strong rainfall. Comparisons with field data of the cool skin taken during the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment confirm the upgraded renewal model. Surface salinity measurements taken during the same field campaign are consistent with the calculated salinity differences across the freshwater skin. The enhancement of surface roughness by natural rain is less pronounced than described in earlier laboratory studies of rain with large drop sizes only.},

  abstract = {The mixed layer (ML) temperature and salinity changes in the central tropical Atlantic have been studied by a dedicated experiment (Cold Tongue Experiment (CTE)) carried out from May-July 2011. The CTE was based on two successive research cruises, a glider swarm, and moored observations. The acquired in-situ datasets together with satellite, reanalysis, and assimilation model data were used to evaluate box-averaged ML heat and salinity budgets for two sub-regions: 1) the western equatorial Atlantic Cold Tongue (ACT) (23Â°-10Â°W) and 2) the region north of the ACT. The strong ML heat loss in the ACT region during the CTE was found to be the result of the balance of warming due to net surface heat flux and cooling due to zonal advection and diapycnal mixing. The northern region was characterized by weak cooling and the dominant balance of net surface heat flux and zonal advection. A strong salinity increase occurred at the equator, 10Â°W, just before the CTE. During the CTE, ML salinity in the ACT region slightly increased. Largest contributions to the ML salinity budget were zonal advection and the net surface freshwater flux. While essential for the ML heat budget in the ACT region, diapycnal mixing played only a minor role for the ML salinity budget. In the region north of the ACT, the ML freshened at the beginning of the CTE due to precipitation, followed by a weak salinity increase. Zonal advection changed sign contributing to ML freshening at the beginning of the CTE and salinity increase afterward.},

  abstract = {A monthly, isopycnal/mixed-layer ocean climatology (MIMOC), global from 0 to 1950âdbar, is compared with other monthly ocean climatologies. All available quality-controlled profiles of temperature (T) and salinity (S) versus pressure (P) collected by conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instruments from the Argo Program, Ice-Tethered Profilers, and archived in the World Ocean Database are used. MIMOC provides maps of mixed layer properties (conservative temperature, Î, absolute salinity, SA, and maximum P) as well as maps of interior ocean properties (Î, SA, and P) to 1950âdbar on isopycnal surfaces. A third product merges the two onto a pressure grid spanning the upper 1950âdbar, adding more familiar potential temperature (Î¸) and practical salinity (S) maps. All maps are at monthly 0.5Â°âÃâ0.5Â° resolution, spanning from 80Â°S to 90Â°N. Objective mapping routines used and described here incorporate an isobath-following component using a âFast Marchingâ algorithm, as well as front-sharpening components in both the mixed layer and on interior isopycnals. Recent data are emphasized in the mapping. The goal is to compute a climatology that looks as much as possible like synoptic surveys sampled circa 2007-2011 during all phases of the seasonal cycle, minimizing transient eddy and wave signatures. MIMOC preserves a surface mixed layer, minimizes both diapycnal and isopycnal smoothing of Î¸-S, as well as preserves density structure in the vertical (pycnoclines and pycnostads) and the horizontal (fronts and their associated currents). It is statically stable and resolves water mass features, fronts, and currents with a high level of detail and fidelity.},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of evaporation and precipitation over the ocean (its hydrologic cycle) is one of the least understood elements of the climate system. However, it is now considered one of the most important, especially for ocean circulation changes on decadal to millennial time-scales. The ocean covers 70% of the Earth's surface and contains nearly all (97%) of its free water, thus, it plays a dominant role in the global water cycle. The atmosphere only holds a few centimeters of liquid water, or 0.001% of the total. However, most discussions of the water cycle focus on the rather small component associated with terrestrial processes [Chahine, 1992]. This is understandable, since the water cycle is so vital to agriculture and all of man's activities. Yet current estimates indicate that 86% of global evaporation and 78% of global precipitation occurs over the oceans [Baumgartner and Reichel, 1975]; (Figure 1 ). Since the oceans are the source of most rainwater, it behooves us to work toward a better understanding of the ocean hydrologic cycle; small changes in ocean evaporation and precipitation patterns may have dramatic consequences for the much smaller terrestrial water cycle. For example, if less than 1% of the rain falling on the Atlantic Ocean were to be concentrated in the central US, it would double the discharge of the Mississippi river!},

  Abstract                 = {Monthly gridded global temperature and salinity fields from the near-surface layer down to 2000 m depth based on Argo measurements are used to analyze large-scale variability patterns on annual to interannual time scales during the years 2003-2008. Previous estimates of global hydrographic fluctuations have been derived using different data sets, partly on the basis of scarce sampling. The substantial advantage of this study includes a detailed summary of global variability patterns based on a single and more uniform database. In the upper 400 m, regions of strong seasonal salinity changes differ from regions of strong seasonal temperature changes, and large amplitudes of seasonal salinity are observed in the upper tropical and subpolar global ocean. Strong interannual and decadal changes superimpose long-term changes at northern midlatitudes. In the subtropical and tropical basin, interannual fluctuations dominate the upper 500 m depth. At southern midlatitudes, hydrographic changes occur on interannual and decadal time scales, while long-term changes are predominantly observed in the salinity field. Global mean heat content and steric height changes are clearly associated with a positive trend during the 6 years of measurements.

  Abstract                 = {Summary form only given. There are very few geometries for which exact analytical solutions of a scattering problem are available, and these are almost all limited to bodies whose surface is a complete coordinate surface in one of the six coordinate systems for which the vector wave equation is separable. At the dawn of the last century, the Mie series solution for a homogeneous sphere and the Sommerfeld-Carslaw multiform solution for a perfectly conducting wedge were available, but the ability to extract meaningful information from these was limited, and in England at least, data computed from the Mie series was classified in World War II. With the advent of radar, it became necessary to estimate, and later reduce, the scattering from realistic targets, and this led to significant advances in our analytical capability. This paper presents a personal view of some of the themes that have underlaid scattering work over the past fifty years. Among these are the early computations of the exact eigenfunction expressions for the cone and prolate spheroid; integral equation and transform techniques; the Luneburg-Kline expansion establishing the rigorous connection between geometrical optics and electromagnetic theory, and the introduction by Keller in 1953 of the concept of diffracted rays, leading to the geometrical theory of diffraction; the analogous physical theory of diffraction conceived by Ufuntsev that had physical optics as its base and that, in the hands of Mitzner and others, played a role in stealth technology; and low frequency techniques},

  Abstract                 = {We present closed-form expressions for the correlation functions associated with Gaussian surfaces with certain ocean-like spectra. These correlation functions may be used to derive asymptotic expansions for the Kirchhoff integral with a wide range of validity. Some comparisons with numerical simulations are also presented. Our analysis establishes that the Kirchhoff integral is well approximated by a Bragg scattering model at very high incidence angles (that is, well away from normal incidence) even when conditions for perturbation theory do not apply. We can compute the nonlinear corrections to Bragg explicitly-these corrections grow as one approaches normal incidence. A novel feature of our analysis is the use of the computer mathematics system Mathematica to construct the relevant asymptotic series. These results eliminate the need for extensive amounts of numerical fast Fourier transform (FFT) computation, and may also be used to simplify computations of scattering cross sections from more complex surfaces with spectra that are perturbations of those we have considered},

  abstract = {Recent evidence supports the premise that the subsurface ocean structure plays an important role in modulating air-sea fluxes during hurricane passage, which in turn, affects intensity change. Given the generally sparse in situ data, it has been difficult to provide region-to-basin-wide estimates of isotherm depths and upper-ocean heat content (OHC). In this broader context, satellite-derived sea surface height anomalies (SSHAs) from multiple platforms carrying radar altimeters are blended, objectively analyzed, and combined with a hurricane-season climatology to estimate isotherm depths and OHC within the context of a reduced gravity model at 0.25\B0 spatial intervals in the eastern Pacific Ocean where tropical cyclone intensity change occurs. Measurements from the Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate in 2001, long-term tropical ocean atmosphere mooring network, and volunteer observing ship deploying expendable bathythermograph (XBT) profilers are used to carefully evaluate satellite-based measurements of upper-ocean variability. Regression statistics reveal small biases with slopes of 0.8-0.9 between the subsurface measurements compared with isotherm depths (20\B0 and 26\B0C), and OHC fields derived from objectively analyzed SSHA field. Root-mean-square differences in OHC range between 10 and 15 kJ cm\88\922 or roughly 10-15% of the mean signals. Similar values are found for isotherm depth differences between in situ and inferred satellite-derived values. Blended daily values are used in the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) forecasts as are OHC estimates for the Atlantic Ocean basin. An equivalent OHC variable is introduced that incorporates the strength of the thermocline at the base of the oceanic mixed layer using a climatological stratification parameter â/No, which seems better correlated to hurricane intensity change than just anomalies as observed in Hurricane Juliette in 2001.},

All of the imaging modes of the PALSAR, i.e., single, dual, and full polarimetric strip modes and scanning synthetic aperture radar (SCANSAR), were calibrated and validated using a total of 572 calibration points collected worldwide and distributed targets selected primarily from the Amazon forest. Through raw-data characterization, antenna-pattern estimation using the distributed target data, and polarimetric calibration using the Faraday rotation-free area in the Amazon, we performed the PALSAR radiometric and geometric calibrations and confirmed that the geometric accuracy of the strip mode is 9.7-m root mean square (rms), the geometric accuracy of SCANSAR is 70 m, and the radiometric accuracy is 0.76 dB from a corner-reflector analysis and 0.22 dB from the Amazon data analysis (standard deviation). Polarimetric calibration was successful, resulting in a VV/HH amplitude balance of 1.013 (0.0561 dB) with a standard deviation of 0.062 and a phase balance of 0.612deg with a standard deviation of 2.66deg .},

Data are presented (with suitable illustrations) for an experiment to determine different hydrometeorological conditions and estimates of the accuracy of applied retrieval procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {The Mediterranean region is getting drier. Evaporation has been steadily increasing over the last few decades driven by the rapid surface warming implying an increase of latent heat loss from the sea surface. A long-term decrease of river freshwater discharge has been also observed since the early 1960s, reflecting the impact of both river damming and recent climate change. As a result of the net evaporation increasing rate, the salt content of the basin has been also strongly increasing over the last four to five decades with this salinification signal rapidly travelling from the surface into the deep layers via the intense Mediterranean overturning circulation. Long-term increases were also observed in the salinity of the Levantine Intermediate Water layer throughout the basin, which strongly influences cold-water coral habitats and distribution. Climate models predict that the present warming and salinification trends will be accelerated over this century and they are expected to have strong impacts on marine ecosystems and biodiversity.},

	1854& #{8211;1997 period. Improvements come from the use of updated COADS observations with new quality control procedures and from improved reconstruction methods. In addition error estimates are computed, which include uncertainty from both sampling and analysis errors. Using this method, little global variance can be reconstructed before the 1880s because data are too sparse to resolve enough modes for that period. Error estimates indicate that except in the North Atlantic ERSST is of limited value before 1880, when the uncertainty of the near-global average is almost as large as the signal. In most regions, the uncertainty decreases through most of the period and is smallest after 1950. The large-scale variations of ERSST are broadly consistent with those associated with the Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) reconstruction produced by the Met Office. There are differences due to both the use of different historical bias corrections as well as different data and analysis procedures, but these differences do not change the overall character of the SST variations. Procedures used here produce a smoother analysis compared to HadISST. The smoother ERSST has the advantage of filtering out more noise at the possible cost of filtering out some real variations when sampling is sparse. A rotated EOF analysis of the ERSST anomalies shows that the dominant modes of variation include ENSO and modes associated with trends. Projection of the HadISST data onto the rotated eigenvectors produces time series similar to those for ERSST, indicating that the dominant modes of variation are consistent in both.},

  abstract = {Because of changes in SST sampling methods in the 1940s and earlier, there are biases in the earlier period SSTs relative to the most recent 50 years. Published results from the Met Office have shown the need for historic bias correction and have developed several correction techniques. An independent bias-correction method is developed here from an analysis using nighttime marine air temperatures and SST observations from the Comprehensive Ocean&} # 8211;Atmosphere Data Set (COADS). Because this method is independent
	from methods proposed by the Met Office, the differences indicate
	uncertainties and similarities indicate where users may have more
	confidence in the bias correction. The new method gives results that
	are broadly consistent with the latest Met Office bias estimates.
	However, this bias estimate has a stronger annual cycle of bias in
	the Northern Hemisphere in comparison with the Met Office estimate.
	Both estimates have midlatitude annual cycles, with the greatest
	bias in the cold season, and both have a small annual cycle in the
	Tropics. From the 1850s into the early twentieth century both bias
	estimates increase with time, although this estimate increases slightly
	less than the Met Office estimate over that period. Near-global average
	temperatures are not greatly affected by the choice of bias correction.
	However, the need for a bias correction in some periods may introduce
	greater uncertainty in the global averages. Differences in the bias
	corrections suggest that this bias-induced uncertainty in the near-global
	average may be 0.1& #{176;C in the nineteenth century, with less uncertainty in the early twentieth century.},

  Abstract                 = {We compare sea surface height anomalies observed by satellite altimeters in exact repeat mission orbits to anomalies observed by altimeters in geodetic or drifting orbits. One experiment compares data from the drift of TOPEX between its Tandem and Interleaved missions to repeat-orbit data from Jason-1, ERS-2 and GFO. A second experiment compares data from the ERS-1 non-repeating Geodetic Phases E and F to the repeating TOPEX data. Both studies cover the North Atlantic from 0Â° to 82Â°W and 15Â° to 55Â°N in order to sample both the Gulf Stream and quieter regions. Height anomalies are obtained along repeat and non-repeat orbits alike by use of a mean sea surface model. Each experiment is performed twice, once with the EGM2008 and once with the DNSC08 models, showing that the results are model-independent; DNSC08 yields an insignificant 2 mm lower RMS misfit. To compare anomalies between repeat and non-repeat orbits with different spatio-temporal sampling we grid the 1-Hz along-track point data and interpolate the grid to point values. RMS differences between grids and point values are around 4 cm in quiet areas and 6 cm over the entire region, with negligible difference between misfits to repeat and non-repeat data. A mapped sea surface height anomaly grid built solely from ERS-1 geodetic data captures at least 85% of the variance in repeat-track TOPEX point data. From these results we can conclude that altimeters in suitable non-repeating orbits are as useful for mesoscale oceanographic studies as are repeat orbit missions.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous polyhedral shapes have been proposed as approximations for globes, and the projection most often used is the Gnomonic, with considerable scale and area distortion. Complicated conformal projections have been designed, but an equal-area projection has been used only once, for the icosahedron. The Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area projection can be modified to provide an exactly fitting, perfectly equal-area projection for any polyhedral globe that has regular polygons, but is most satisfactory for the dodecahedron with 12 pentagons and for the truncated icosahedron with 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. On the application to the truncated icosahedron, the angular deformation does not exceed 3.75$\,^{\circ}$, and the scale variation is less than 3.3 percent. These advantages are at the expense of increased interruptions at the polygon edges when the polyhedral globe is unfolded.

  abstract  = {The polarimetric EMIRAD radiometer, based on novel digital down conversion and detection techniques, has been installed on a C-130 aircraft from the Royal Danish. Air Force during the L-band Ocean Salinity Airborne Campaign (LOSAC) in 2001 and 2003. Full 360 deg; circle flight patterns around the same target area as well as clover leaf patterns have been measured, and both provide an azimuth signature of the ocean at a constant incidence angle. The resulting azimuth signatures show significant variations in all the three first Stokes parameters, and a correlation is found between the downwelling galactic background signal and the measured results. The measured 3rd Stokes parameter has variations of the same order of magnitude as the two linear polarizations, and to verify this result, an experiment for direct observation of the sky over long time is set up. This experiment confirms the presence of a polarized galactic background signal, and conclusions are made with respect to the necessity for polarimetric corrections in future measurements over the sea at L-band.},

  abstract = {The lower limit on the drag coefficient under hurricane force winds is determined by the break-up of the air-sea interface due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and formation of the two-phase transition layer consisting of sea spray and air bubbles. As a consequence, a regime of marginal stability develops. In this regime, the air-sea drag coefficient is determined by the turbulence characteristics of the two-phase transition layer. The upper limit on the drag coefficient is determined by the Charnock-type wave resistance. Most of the observational estimates of the drag coefficient obtained in hurricane conditions and in laboratory experiments appear to lie between the two extreme regimes: wave resistance and marginal stability.},

  Abstract                 = {With the emergence of unmanned marine robots, underwater communication systems have received much attention in recent years. To successfully develop radio wave based communication solutions, it is essential to understand properties of electromagnetic wave transmission in seawater. These properties are determined by the frequency variation of the permittivity of seawater. Existing models for the permittivity of saline water are empirical ones that best fit experimental data. We propose a physically realistic model, similar to the one used in plasma physics, for the variation of the dielectric constant of water with varying frequencies and salinities. Our model is in excellent agreement with existing empirical fits for frequencies between 1 and 256 GHz. We use this model to study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in seawater. We explain that large propagation distances would be possible at MHz frequencies if the conductivity of seawater decreases at small field strengths due to the hydrogen bonding of water molecules. However, we were unable to experimentally verify any reduction in the conductivity of seawater},

  Abstract                 = {AbstractThe study examined global variability of air?sea sensible heat flux (SHF) from 1980 to 2009 and the large-scale atmospheric and ocean circulations that gave rise to this variability. The contribution of high-latitude wintertime SHF was identified, and the relative importance of the effect of the sea?air temperature difference versus the effect of wind on decadal SHF variability was analyzed using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) approach. The study showed that global SHF anomalies are strongly modulated by SHF at high latitudes (poleward of 45Â°) during winter seasons. Decadal variability of global wintertime SHF can be reasonably represented by the sum of two leading EOF modes, namely, the boreal wintertime SHF in the northern oceans and the austral wintertime SHF in the southern oceans. The study also showed that global wintertime SHF is modulated by the prominent modes of the large-scale atmospheric circulation at high latitudes. The increase of global SHF in the 1990s is attributable to the strengthening of the Southern Hemisphere annular mode index, while the decrease of global SHF after 2000 is due primarily to the downward trend of the Arctic Oscillation index. This study identified the important effects of wind direction and speed on SHF variability. Changes in winds modify the sea?air temperature gradient by advecting cold and dry air from continents and by imposing changes in wind-driven oceanic processes that affect sea surface temperature (SST). The pattern of air temperature anomalies dominates over the pattern of SST anomalies and dictates the pattern of decadal SHF variability.

  Abstract                 = {A new global, operational, high-resolution, combined sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice analysis system (OSTIA) has been developed at the Met Office. The output is a daily, global coverage 1/20deg (~6 km) combined SST and sea ice concentration product, which is generated in near-real time. The analysis has been designed to meet the needs of applications requiring high-resolution space-time scales including global numerical weather prediction (NWP) and operational ocean models and to prepare for future high-resolution global and regional forecast systems.},

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that convective âfingersâ can form not only in the salt-heat system, but also in a fluid containing two solutes with much closer diffusivities (for example sugar above a salt solution). This experimental device is used to explore various phenomena which cannot easily be produced in the laboratory with salt and heat. We have investigated: (a) the behaviour of an interface containing fingers and separating two convecting layers, (b) the production of a series of steps from a smooth gradients by imposing a flux at the top, (c) and the mechanism of formation of layers from two opossing gradient bof the solutes. In each case the related theoretical ideas are summarized, and it is suggested how these can be extended to describe the new features of the observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Several fully connected, feed forward neural networks trained on a set of special sensor microwave imager examples matched with buoy winds have yielded retrieval accuracies considerably better than those achieved by the current operational method. Equations and coefficients for using two of these networks, each with four input brightness temperatures and a hidden layer containing two neurodes, are given for implementation in wind retrieval codes. The first demonstrated an rms retrieval error of 1.41 m/s at a reference height of 19.5 m using an independent data set representing clear sky conditions. The second network yielded rms retrieval accuracies of 2.39 m/s under adverse weather conditions. This represents a factor of more than 2 improvement over the alternate algorithms that were examined for nonclear conditions.},

There are many challenges to measuring salinity from space and obtaining a targeted accuracy of 0.1 psu. Comparisons of Level 2 (L2) SMOS SSS data with the 1/12$^{circ}$ high resolution HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) simulations of SSS reveal large differences. These differences are minimized for an extent during the creation of Level 3 (L3) SMOS data through spatial and temporal averaging. Depending on the retrieval algorithm used, there are differences between ascending and descending passes with data collected during the descending pass exhibiting a bias toward lower SSS. It is challenging to process SMOS SSS data in the northern Indian Ocean due to radio frequency interference and large seasonal variability due to monsoonal circulation. Comparisons of SMOS L3 data with Argo float SSS and HYCOM SSS indicate the lowest discrepancies in SSS for these data sets occur in the southern tropical Indian Ocean and the largest differences between the compared salinity products are noticed in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal with an erratic root mean square error in the latter region. Higher errors in SSS occurred in coastal areas compared to the open ocean. The accuracy of SMOS salinity measurements is increasing with the maturity of the data and new algorithms.},

  abstract = {Surface currents in oceanic environments are of crucial importance because they transport momentum, heat, salt, and tracers over large distances that regulate both the local and large-scale climate conditions, and because they contribute to the Lagrangian displacement of floating material, ranging from living resources to marine pollution. In recent decades, the understanding of surface currents has benefited from the opportunity of observing sea level and wind stress via satellite-derived measurements. Combining these parameters into geostrophic and wind-driven components provides an estimate of surface currents with a quarter-degree horizontal resolution at a global scale and at a daily time scale. In the present study, improvements are made on the consideration of the time dependence of the main parameters implied in the determination of the Ekman wind-driven component, and on the treatment of the equatorial singularity. The resulting Geostrophic and Ekman Current Observatory (GEKCO) estimates were validated with independent observations from both Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives. The statistics of comparison were significant over the globe for the 2000-2008 period. The only exception was the estimation of meridional current along the equator, which requires further developments of the dynamic model and, probably, more accurate measurements. Applications using our GEKCO surface current estimates in cross-disciplinary approaches from physical oceanography to marine ecology are presented and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Field observations were carried out at a sea observation tower to investigate how whitecap coverage on the ocean surface responds to wave-field conditions. Images of whitecaps were taken for every 4 h or 7 h in the daytime using a 3CCD digital video camera fixed at 14 m elevation, and they were stored automatically in a hard disk video recorder at a time interval of 1 s. The determination of whitecap coverage was made by means of a digital image processing. The 1/3 power of whitecap coverage increases linearly with increasing the 10-m neutral wind speed. On the basis of the deflection angle between the propagating directions of wind waves and swell, wave-field conditions are classified into four cases. The present results show that whitecaps are produced most actively under the condition of the pure windsea and they tend to be suppressed by the presence of swell. It is difficult to find a certain relation between the deflection angle and whitecap coverage. Whitecap coverage also increases with the wave age in the same wind-speed conditions.},

The buoy latent and sensible heat fluxes are determined from buoy measurements using the recently improved Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean?Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) flux algorithm. The time mean oceanic heat loss from the model analyses is systematically overestimated in all the regions. The overestimation in latent heat loss ranges from about 14 W m?2 (13%) in the eastern subtropical North Atlantic to about 29 W m?2 (30%) in the Tropics to about 30 W m?2 (49%) in the midlatitude coastal areas, where the overestimation in sensible heat flux reaches about 20 W m?2 (60%). Depending upon the region and the NWP model, these systematic overestimations are either reduced, or change to underestimations, or remain unchanged when the TOGA COARE flux algorithm is used to recalculate the fluxes. The bias in surface meteorological variables, one of the major factors related to the biases in the revised NWP heat fluxes, varies with region and NWP analysis. Generally the temperature and humidity biases in the coastal regions are much larger than other regions. In the extratropical regions, NCEP1 and NCEP2 generally show a wet bias, which is mainly responsible for the underestimation in the revised NWP latent heat loss. In the Tropics a dry bias is found in the NWP analyses, particularly in ECMWF and NCEP2, which contributes to the overestimation in the revised NWP latent heat loss. Compared to NCEP1, NCEP2 shows less cold bias in 2-m air temperature and thus less biased sensible heat flux; NCEP2 also shows less humid bias in 2-m humidity in the extratropical regions but more dry bias in 2-m humidity in the Tropics, either of which leads to a more biased latent heat flux in NCEP2. Despite the significant biases in the NWP surface fields and the poor representation of short-time sea surface temperature variability, the NWP models are able to represent the dominant short-time variability in other basic variables and thus the variability in heat fluxes in the wintertime coastal regions of the western North Atlantic (on timescales of 3?4 days and 1 week) and the northern and southern subtropical regions (on a timescale of about 2 weeks), but ECMWF and particularly the NCEP analyses do not represent well the 2?3-week variability in the tropical Atlantic.

The overestimation in latent heat loss ranges from about 14 W m?2 (13%) in the eastern subtropical North Atlantic to about 29 W m?2 (30%) in the Tropics to about 30 W m?2 (49%) in the midlatitude coastal areas, where the overestimation in sensible heat flux reaches about 20 W m?2 (60%). Depending upon the region and the NWP model, these systematic overestimations are either reduced, or change to underestimations, or remain unchanged when the TOGA COARE flux algorithm is used to recalculate the fluxes. The bias in surface meteorological variables, one of the major factors related to the biases in the revised NWP heat fluxes, varies with region and NWP analysis. Generally the temperature and humidity biases in the coastal regions are much larger than other regions. In the extratropical regions, NCEP1 and NCEP2 generally show a wet bias, which is mainly responsible for the underestimation in the revised NWP latent heat loss. In the Tropics a dry bias is found in the NWP analyses, particularly in ECMWF and NCEP2, which contributes to the overestimation in the revised NWP latent heat loss. Compared to NCEP1, NCEP2 shows less cold bias in 2-m air temperature and thus less biased sensible heat flux; NCEP2 also shows less humid bias in 2-m humidity in the extratropical regions but more dry bias in 2-m humidity in the Tropics, either of which leads to a more biased latent heat flux in NCEP2. Despite the significant biases in the NWP surface fields and the poor representation of short-time sea surface temperature variability, the NWP models are able to represent the dominant short-time variability in other basic variables and thus the variability in heat fluxes in the wintertime coastal regions of the western North Atlantic (on timescales of 3?4 days and 1 week) and the northern and southern subtropical regions (on a timescale of about 2 weeks), but ECMWF and particularly the NCEP analyses do not represent well the 2?3-week variability in the tropical Atlantic.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] The assumption that tropical cyclones respond primarily to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) local to their main development regions underlies much of the concern regarding the possible impacts of anthropogenic greenhouse warming on tropical cyclone statistics. Here the observed relationship between changes in sea surface temperature and tropical cyclone intensities in the Atlantic basin is explored. Atlantic tropical cyclone intensity fluctuations and storm numbers are shown to depend not only upon SST anomalies local to the Atlantic main development region, but also in a negative sense upon the tropical mean SST. This behavior is shown in part to be consistent with changes in the tropical cyclone potential intensity that provides an upper bound on storm intensity. However, Atlantic tropical cyclone intensity fluctuations are more nonlocal than the potential intensity itself and specifically vary along with Atlantic main development region SST anomalies relative to the tropical mean SST. This suggests that there is no straightforward link between warmer SSTs in the main development region and more intense tropical cyclones.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission is the second of European Space Agency's (ESA) Living Planet Programme Earth Explorer Opportunity Missions. SMOS's objective is to provide global and frequent Soil Moisture and Sea Surface Salinity maps. The single payload embarked on SMOS is the Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS), it is a 2D interferometric radiometer operating at the protected L-band with a nominal frequency of 1413.5 MHz. Since SMOS is the first 2D interferometric radiometers put in orbit so far, the characterization of the interferometrically measured brightness temperatures is an attractive topic for the scientific community. This study is focused on the estimation of the systematic antenna-based pattern in the measured brightness temperatures. Two improvements to the currently used method (Ocean Target Transformation) are proposed: 1) The elimination of the use of any forward model in the estimation of the bias. 2) The homogenization of the geophysical parameters distribution within the SMOS Field of View. Ocean Target Transformation is introduced in section 2, the proposed model-free methodology is described in section 3, while the effect of homogenizing the geophysical parameters distribution inside the FOV is assessed in section 4. The main conclusions are presented in section 5.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieved from SMAP radiometer measurements are validated against in situ salinity from Argo floats, tropical moored buoys and ship-based thermosalinograph (TSG) data. SMAP SSS achieved an accuracy of 0.2PSU on a monthly basis in comparison with Argo gridded data in the tropics and mid-latitudes. In the tropical oceans, time series comparison of salinity measured at 1m by moored buoys indicates that SMAP can track large salinity changes occurred within a month. Synergetic analysis of SMAP, SMOS and Argo data allows us to identify and exclude erroneous jumps or drift in some real-time buoy data from the assessment of the satellite data. The resulting SMAP-buoy matchup analysis gives an average standard deviation of 0.22PSU and correlation coefficient of 0.73 on weekly scale. On monthly time scales, the average standard deviation reduced to 0.17PSU and the correlation coefficient improved to 0.8. SMAP L3 daily maps reveals salty water intrusions from the Arabian Sea into the Bay of Bengal during the Indian summer monsoon, consistent with the daily measurements collected from Argo floats deployed during the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE) project field campaign. In the Mediterranean Sea, the spatial pattern of SSS from SMAP is confirmed by the ship-based TSG. Comparison with individual Argo floats suggests the SMAP retrieval algorithm performs better in the Western Mediterranean region, but suffers from radio-frequency interference (RFI) and land contamination in the Eastern Mediterranean region and Adriatic Sea.},

The residual signals due to rain are derived from measurements after accounting for roughness due to wind and flat surface emissivity. The wind roughness is accounted for by a geophysical model function (GMF) built using rain-free data. Using more than one year of Aquarius data collocated with SSMI/S, WindSAT rain rate and NCEP wind, our analysis reveals rain rate dependence in radar backscatter and surface emissivity, which become increasingly significant as the wind speed approaches zero and not significant above 15 m sâ 1. The effect of rain on radar backscatter is dominated by raindrop splashing as indicated by the incidence angle dependence and polarization characteristics of the residuals.},

Rain has instantaneous impact on SSS, but also interferes with the microwave remote sensing signals, making the task to retrieve SSS under rainy conditions difficult. A rain correction model is developed based on analysis of the L-band radiometer/scatterometer residual signals after accounting for roughness due to wind and flat surface emissivity. The combined active passive algorithm is used to retrieve SSS in parallel with (CAP_RC) or without rain correction (CAP). The CAP bias against individual ARGO floats increases with rain rate with slope of -0.14 PSU per mm hr-1, which reduced to near zero in CAP_RC. On the global monthly basis, CAP_RC is about 0.03 PSU higher than CAP. RMSD against ARGO is slightly smaller for CAP_RC than CAP. Regional biases are examined in areas with frequent rain events. As expected, results show that ÎSSS (CAP_RC-CAP) is highly correlated with the seasonal precipitation pattern, reaching about 0.2-0.3 PSU under heavy rain. However, ÎSSS shows no correlation with the difference pattern between ARGO and CAP or CAP_RC. This, along with regional analyses, suggests that the difference between ARGO and Aquariusâ SSS is likely caused by the different spatial and temporal sampling, in addition to near surface stratification depicted by radiometer and ARGO at different depths. The effect of ÎSSS on water cycle in terms of mixed-layer salt storage tendency is about 10% in areas where evaporation-minus-precipitation is the dominant process driving the variability of near surface salinity.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the theory of waves scattered from a moving, rough, and dispersive surface in the small perturbation limit. The first-order scattered field for a time-dependent surface is obtained in the far zone of scattering in terms of the two-dimensional spectral amplitude of the surface and its dispersion relation. We develop a rigorous Delta;k radar theory and show that the nonzero output of a Delta;k radar occurs only when the Bragg condition for each signal component is satisfied separately. The frequency correlation function of the scattered field is then proportional to the mean value of the product of the spectral amplitudes of the surface at the corresponding Bragg wavenumbers. The mean value of this product is nonzero only for surfaces that have a locally varying spectrum and is proportional to the Fourier transform (with the argument Delta;k) of the variation of the local spectrum with respect to the pattern position. Such variations may be caused by either amplitude or phase modulation of the surface structure. In the former case, our results are similar to the results of existing theory. The latter case of phase modulation of the surface (for example, internal waves interacting with capillary waves) cannot be explained by previous theory},

  abstract = {We consider a scattering theory for multi-valued rough surfaces which cannot be described by the conventional equation of the type z = Î¶(x,y). Both Dirichlet and Neumann problems are analyzed. Starting with Green's theorem we obtain a representation of the scattered field, the surface integral equation, and the extinction theorem for such surfaces. In contrast to conventional theory, these equations contain three random functions x = x(u 1,u 2), y = y(u 1,u 2), and z = z(u 1,u 2), where u 1 and u 2 are the parameters describing the surface. We introduce two scattering amplitudes S Â± for describing the scattered wave above and below the surface. The extinction theorem, if formulated in terms of S â, allows us to determine S â for an arbitrary multi-valued surface and after this it becomes possible to derive a simple integral equation for surface sources. Knowledge of the surface sources allows us to find S + by integration.},

  Abstract                 = {The ldquogalactic glitterrdquo phenomenon at L-band, i.e., the scattering of celestial sky radiation by the rough ocean surface, is examined here as a potential source of error for sea surface salinity (SSS) remote sensing. We begin by considering the transformations that must be applied to downwelling celestial noise in order to compute the eventual impact on the antenna temperature. Then, outside the context of any particular measurement system, we use approximate scattering models along with a model for the equilibrium wind wave spectrum to examine how the scattered signal at the surface might depend on the geophysical conditions and scattering geometry. It is found that, when the specular point lies far away from the galactic plane, where the incident celestial brightness is uniform, sea surface roughness has a negligible impact on the glitter. At such a point, variations in both the orientation of the incidence plane and the wind direction relative to the scattering azimuth have negligible impact. By contrast, when the specular point lies in the vicinity of a localized maximum of brightness, scattering by the roughened ocean surface may reduce the glitter by more than 30%, as compared to a perfectly flat surface, and the glitter amplitude may vary by up to 0.7 K with variations in wind direction and by up to 0.5 K with variations in incidence plane orientation. It is shown that accounting for the roughness impact on celestial noise contamination is of particular concern for the remote sensing of SSS.},

Two-dimensional turbulence is a model for the statistical features of large-scale flows in the atmosphere. The differences between two- and three-dimensional turbulence are discussed, with a minimum of mathematics, in terms of elementary vorticity dynamics. The influence of the microstructure on the evolution of the large-scale features of the flow field is explored in some detail. A simple rationale is given for ignoring subgrid scale fluxes in numerical weather prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {Cyclonic Gulf Stream rings are energetic eddies in the warm Sargasso Sea consisting of a ring of Gulf Stream water surrounding a core of cold Slope Water. Initially a ring core has the characteristics of the Slope Water; it is rich in plants, animals, and nutrients. As a ring decays the Slope Water properties of its core are gradually replaced by those of the Sargasso Sea, where standing crops of plants, animals, and nutrients generally are low. Although the decay rate suggests a rather long lifetime (2 to 4 years), the usual death of a ring comes when it rejoins the Gulf Stream after 6 to 12 months.},

  Abstract                 = {The present paper shows that a wide class of complex transfer functions encountered in geophysics can be efficiently modeled using neural networks. Neural networks can approximate numerical and nonnumerical transfer functions. They provide an optimum basis of nonlinear functions allowing a uniform approximation of any continuous function. Neural networks can also realize classification tasks. It is shown that the classifier mode is related to Bayes discriminant functions, which give the minimum error risk classification. This mode is useful for extracting information from an unknown process. These properties are applied to the ERS1 simulated scatterometer data. Compared to other methods, neural network solutions are the most skillful.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) brightness temperature synthesized images are obtained after a comprehensive error correction procedure that takes into account both on-ground and in-flight calibration measurements. However, the final images are still contaminated by small, although nonnegligible, spatial errors: the so-called pixel bias. Since spatial errors in the 2-D SMOS images are not zero mean along track, these errors produce clearly visible artifacts aligned to this direction. Fortunately, spatial errors have been found to be very stable and can be minimized once the image distortion pattern is properly measured by observing a target at a uniform brightness temperature distribution. This letter describes the procedure to compute a multiplicative mask that largely reduces spatial errors over the ocean. Preliminary results to assess the mask performance are also presented by computing the reduction of the rms spatial error for a number of targets selected to have significant temporal and geographical diversity.},

  Abstract                 = {In the present paper, the probability for a mesoscale oceanic rings to be seen by a perfect satellite altimeter is investigated. First, the motion of a ring center is determined using a stochastic differential equation. The problem of radar altimeter sampling is then investigated, first in the one-dimensional case, then for two dimensions. The probability of a ring to be seen by a satellite is then computed and is shown to depend on the satellite period and fundamental interval, the mean and standard deviation of the ring speed, and the distance between the ring center and the nearest track when the ring appears. The maximum of this probability and the time at which the maximum arises give an estimate of the satellite ability to sense the rings. The observation of Gulf Stream (GS) warm and cold core rings (WCR/CCR) by the Topex-Poseidon and Geosat altimeters are then presented as examples. For both satellites and ring events, the probability for the ring center to lie on a satellite track (i.e., the entire ring signal is seen) is very low (less than 5%). However, more than 90% of the GS WCRs and 65% of the GS CCRs are seen at least once (i.e., the distance between the ring center and a satellite track is less than the ring radius) with a probability over 80%. The mean probability for the satellite to see a significant part of the ring signal (the distance between the ring center and a satellite track is less than half the ring radius) drops to about 50%. Aliasing between ring motion and satellite sampling should be taken into account during the definition of altimetric data assimilation methods for numerical models. On the other hand, the probability of view is high enough to indicate that altimetric data could improve climatological and statistical studies of mesoscale eddies.},

  Abstract                 = {Rain can strongly modify the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) measured by Ku-band scatterometers and alter the wind vector retrieval. Part 1 of this paper (Tournadre and Quilfen, 2003) presented a theoretical model of interaction between rain and scatterometer signal and used it to quantify the effect of rain on the backscatter and on wind vectors. Their results showed that the scatterometer data are strongly affected by rain, that they are extremely sensitive to the rain distribution within scatterometer resolution cells, and that the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) variability induced by rain could be a good indicator for rain flagging. The model is further tested and validated on a tropical cyclone case using colocated high resolution rain and Seawinds NRCS data. The model is used to compute attenuation and volume scattering from Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission Precipitation Radar (TRMM PR) rain data. The comparison of the high-resolution (4 km) NRCS to synthetic NRCS computed from National Hurricane Center (NHC) winds and modeled rain terms shows a good qualitative agreement. The rain terms are used to correct the measured NRCS, to infer corrected winds which are significantly improved compared to NHC winds, especially for high winds. The wind correction using low-resolution rain data (such as Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) ones) is also investigated using rain data averaged over wind scatterometer cells. This can also significantly improve the rain retrieval. A new rain flag based on the NRCS variability within wind vector cells is presented and shown to perform better than the operational one.},

  Abstract                 = {The two scatterometers currently in operation, the Ku-band NASA Seawinds on the QuikScat satellite and the C-band AMI-Wind on the ERS-2 satellite, are designed to infer the ocean wind vectors from sea surface radar backscatter measurements. They provide excellent coverage of the ocean, and their wind products are of great value for ocean and meteorological communities. However, the presence of rain within scatterometer cells can significantly modify the sea surface backscatter coefficient and hence alter the wind vector retrieval. These perturbations can hamper the analysis of wind fields within atmospheric low-pressure systems or tropical cyclones. Rain perturbations result from volume scattering and attenuation by raindrops in the atmosphere as well as changes of sea surface roughness by impinging drops. For scatterometers operating at Ku-Band, attenuation and volume scattering are strong and one order of magnitude larger than at C-band. The wind retrieval will thus be less affected for the C-band AMI-Wind instrument than for the Ku-band Seawinds. A theoretical model, based on radiative transfer formulation including rain attenuation and scattering, has been developed to quantify the modification by rain of the measured backscatter and of the retrieved wind vectors. Changes in surface roughness, a complex phenomenon not yet fully understood and parameterized, is not considered here although it could be of importance for high rain rates. As a scatterometer cell covers several hundred square kilometers, inhomogeneities of rain within the cell will further modify the measured backscatter, particularly in case of small, intense precipitating rain cells. Using analytical rain cell models and constant wind fields, the effects of partial beam filling by rain is investigated. The model results show that Ku-band scatterometer data are greatly affected by rain and are extremely sensitive to the distribution of rain within scatterometer cells, i.e., to the distance between the rain cell center and the scatterometer resolution cell center. When the scatter from the sea surface is low, the additional volume scattering from rain will have a marked effect leading to an overestimation of the low wind speed actually present. Conversely, when the backscatter is already high (at high winds), attenuation by rain will reduce the signal causing an underestimation of the wind speed. The wind direction is modified in a complex manner and mainly depends on the rain distribution within the scatterometer cell. These results show that, especially at low and moderate wind speed, rain data such as the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) rain fields are too coarse for correction of Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) and that high-resolution rain data (such as the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission (TRMM) ones) are necessary. They also show that a good rain flagging is still an important issue for the operational use of Ku-band scatterometer data. A succeeding paper will present an example of application of the model for the correction of QuikScat data using TRMM rain data within a tropical cyclone.},

  Abstract                 = {Changing surface wave conditions alter the altimeter's estimate of mean sea level. Present-day methods for correcting this bias are solely based on wave and wind information from the altimeter. This paper tests the use of additional information to develop several sea state bias correction models using a yearlong combination of Jason-1 data with wave field statistics generated from the WaveWatch3 ocean wave model hindcast. Each candidate model is produced in the same manner, using a nonparametric mapping between Jason-1 sea surface height anomaly estimates and two correlatives. The first is always the significant wave height from Jason-1 and the model differences come through choice of the second variable. Past studies dictate our selection of these second parameters and they include terms related to the local wind speed, swell energy, wave age, wave period, and wave slope. Model skills are evaluated in terms of explained variance. Several models indicate promise for wave model use in future empirical developments. For instance, results show that in the low latitudes the models developed using the swell height and mean period modestly but systematically outperform the actual operational parameterisation. This study further indicates that systematic regional error in the present sea level corrections may be improved by inclusion of wave model information.},

Observations of the downwelling atmospheric radiation as a function of angle were used to achieve a highly accurate absolute calibration. The dependence of the sea surface brightness temperature on nadir and azimuthal angles is considered. The experimental data are compared with theoretical calculations based on several models of sea wave spectra. Models proposed by Romeiser et al. [1997] and Elfouhaily et al. [1997] fit well to the COPE azimuthal measurements and data averaged over azimuthal angle are in between of values predicted by spectrum models by Apel [1994] and Elfouhaily et al. [1997]. The conclusion is made about high sensitivity of the polarized radiometric measurements to parameters of gravity-capillary spectrum.},

  Abstract                 = {The results of polarimetric microwave measurements of thermal emission from a water surface with artificial periodic structure are presented. The goal of the experiment is to verify the results of a model describing polarized microwave emission from gravity-capillary waves on a sea surface. Periodic undulations of water surface were produced in a tank by a set of parallel nylon threads raised slightly above the mean surface. Due to surface tension, the water surface assumes a periodic profile; the amplitude of the roughness was changed by moving the frame with the threads up and down. The measurements of the three Stokes parameters of the emission were carried out with the Ka-band polarimeter. The experimental setup allowed measurements to be made over a wide range of view angles (from near-nadir to 70Â°). The tank rotation allowed variation of the azimuthal angle between the periodic structure and the observation plane of more than 300Â°. The experimental data show the existence of the resonant peak in the Stokes parameters predicted by the model. The amplitude of the peak reached 10 K. Also, drastic contrasts were registered in the azimuth dependencies of the Stokes parameters. This result is evidence of the important role that short gravity-capillary waves play in sea-surface polarized microwave emission.},

  Abstract                 = {A commonly used method of simulating ocean waves from a specified frequency spectrum is shown to be incorrect. The method consists of adding numerous sine curves with random phases; and the error arises from assuming that the amplitudes of these component sine waves are deterministic, when they are in fact random variables. Methods of using random amplitudes are described and only one is found to be satisfactory. In this method the number of random values simulated \'e and then transformed with an inverse FFT \'e equals the required number of simulated data points. So simulation in the frequency domain can only give relatively short runs; it is necessary to work in the time domain if arbitrarily long runs are required. Errors in wave group statistics derived from the incorrect simulation method are discussed and related to discrepancies reported between groupiness in simulated data and ocean measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Physical variables in scale invariant systems often show chaotic, turbulent-like behavior, commonly associated to the existence of an underlying fractal or multifractal structure. However, the assessment of multifractality over experimental, discretized data requires of appropriate methods and to establish criteria to measure the confidence degree on the estimates. In this paper we have evaluated the quality of different techniques used for multifractal analysis. We have tested four different techniques: the moment (M) method, the wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) method, the gradient modulus wavelet projection (GMWP) method and the gradient histogram (GH) method, which are used to estimate the singularity spectra of multifractal signals. The test consists in analyzing synthetic multifractal 1D signals with given multifractal spectrum. We have compared the results, studying the sensibility of each method to the length of the series, size of the ensemble and type of spectrum. Our results show that GMWP method is the one attaining the best performance, providing reliable estimates which can be improved when the statistics is increased. All the other methods are affected by problems such as the linearization of the right tail of the spectrum, and some of them are very demanding in data.},

  Abstract                 = {In the recent years, the power of employing singularity analysis of scalar variables to perform pattern recognition in complex images has been evidenced. This approach is particularly useful when the image under study corresponds to a scalar variable submitted to a turbulent flow because, in that case, the arrangement of singularity manifolds corresponds to the multifractal hierarchy from the underlying turbulent flow. In this paper we will show how this intimate connection between Image Processing and Physics, when applied to Microwave Sea Surface Temperature images, allows to uncover global circulation patterns in the ocean at a daily basis with the resolution of 1/4 of degree. Using this technique, details not evidenced in the non-processed image are revealed. The emerging patterns provide a description of the global oceanic currents much richer than the usual global circulation scheme; in particular, instabilities, eddy generation and filamentation are distinctly identified. A pattern extraction of this kind is useful in order to measure and track mesoscale oceanic phenomena, opening the way to many operational and reanalysis applications.},

  abstract = {Radio-wave scattering from natural surfaces contains a strong quasispecular component that at fixed wavelengths is consistent with specular-point theory, but often has a strong wavelength dependence that is not predicted by physical optics calculations under the usual limitations of specular-point models. Wavelength dependence can be introduced by a physical approximation that preserves the specular-point assumptions with respect to the radii of curvature of a fictitious, effective scattering surface obtained by smoothing the actual surface. Wavelength dependence of the scattering, as expressed in terms of the mean-square tilt of the smoothed surface, then depends on an integral of the two-dimensional surface power spectral density. A uniform low-pass filter model of the scattering process yields explicit results for the effective surface roughness versus wavelength. Interpretation of experimental results from planetary surfaces indicates that the asymptotic surface height spectral densities fall at least as fast as an inverse cube of spatial frequency. Asymptotic spectral densities for Mars and portions of the lunar surface evidently decrease more rapidly, at least as fast as an inverse fourth or fifth law of the spatial frequency.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The correlation between parameters characterizing observed westerly wind bursts (WWBs) in the equatorial Pacific and the large-scale SST is analyzed using singular value decomposition. The WWB parameters include the amplitude, location, scale, and probability of occurrence for a given SST distribution rather than the wind stress itself. This approach therefore allows for a nonlinear relationship between the SST and the wind signal of the WWBs. It is found that about half of the variance of the WWB parameters is explained by only two large-scale SST modes. The first mode represents a developed El NiÃ±o event, while the second mode represents the seasonal cycle. More specifically, the central longitude of WWBs, their longitudinal extent, and their probability seem to be determined to a significant degree by the ENSO-driven signal. The amplitude of the WWBs is found to be strongly influenced by the phase of the seasonal cycle. It is concluded that the WWBs, while partially stochastic, seem an inherent part of the large-scale deterministic ENSO dynamics. Implications for ENSO predictability and prediction are discussed.

  abstract = {Abstract Using the information of an ocean variable of a given kind to improve another variable of a different kind may be a challenging task, especially when they undergo different physical processes. Statistical methods and assimilation in numerical models had been so far the main ways to perform this type of blending, but these are relatively complicated methods that usually introduce other sources of error and uncertainty. In this paper, the existence of a multifractal hierarchy pervading the structure of all ocean scalars is exploited to introduce a new blending method. This method is not parametric and requires no knowledge about the physics governing the evolution of the scalars, provided that both scalars have the same multifractal structure. We have applied this methodology to \{SMOS\} \{SSS\} maps, using \{OI\} \{SST\} maps as template variables, observing not only a qualitative but also a significant quantitative improvement.},

  Abstract                 = {New aircraft observations are presented on the range determination error in satellite altimetry associated with ocean waves. Laser-based measurements of the cross correlation between the gravity wave slope and elevation are reported for the first time. These observations provide direct access to a long, O(10 m), gravity wave statistic central to nonlinear wave theory prediction of the altimeter sea state bias. Coincident Ka-band radar scattering data are used to estimate an electromagnetic (EM) range bias analogous to that in satellite altimetry. These data, along with ancillary wind and wave slope variance estimates, are used alongside existing theory to evaluate the extent of long- versus short-wave, O(cm), control of the bias. The longer wave bias contribution to the total EM bias is shown to range from 25 to as much as 100%. Moreover, on average the term is linearly related to wind speed and to the gravity wave slope variance, consistent with WNL theory. The EM bias associated with interactions between long and short waves is obtained assuming the effect is additive to the independently observed long-wave factor. This second component is also a substantial contributor, is observed to be quadratic in wind speed or wave slope, and dominates at moderate wind speeds. The behavior is shown to be consistent with EM bias prediction based in hydrodynamic modulation theory. Study implications for improved correction of the on-orbit satellite sea state bias are discussed.},

A simple three laser altimeter arrangement is used to directly measure the 2-D slope of intermediate scale waves and the surface wave profile.

This NOAA Long-EZ aircraft then provides high resolution air-sea data with application to such topics as the modulation transfer function, large-scale atmospheric impacts on the sea surface, and characterization of sea surface statistics},

  Abstract                 = {The two-dimensional problem of horizontally polarized wave scattering from an airground interface is considered. The diffraction problem is formulated by means of the extinction theorem, leading to a system of two simultaneous surface integral equations. Three perturbation techniques, namely the small-perturbation method, the phase perturbation method, and the small-slope approximation, have been applied to this system. Iterative relations for the terms of arbitrary order are obtained for each perturbation series. For the sinusoidal surface a benchmark solution, which remains stable near the points of Wood's anomalies, is developed. It is used to establish the area of validity of each perturbation technique by means of numerical comparison.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study examines the response of the tropical atmospheric and oceanic circulation to increasing greenhouse gases using a coordinated set of twenty-first-century climate model experiments performed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The strength of the atmospheric overturning circulation decreases as the climate warms in all IPCC AR4 models, in a manner consistent with the thermodynamic scaling arguments of Held and Soden. The weakening occurs preferentially in the zonally asymmetric (i.e., Walker) rather than zonal-mean (i.e., Hadley) component of the tropical circulation and is shown to induce substantial changes to the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical oceans. Evidence suggests that the overall circulation weakens by decreasing the frequency of strong updrafts and increasing the frequency of weak updrafts, although the robustness of this behavior across all models cannot be confirmed because of the lack of data. As the climate warms, changes in both the atmospheric and ocean circulation over the tropical Pacific Ocean resemble âEl Ni\~no-like\80\9D conditions; however, the mechanisms are shown to be distinct from those of El NiÃ±o and are reproduced in both mixed layer and full ocean dynamics coupled climate models. The character of the Indian Ocean response to global warming resembles that of Indian Ocean dipole mode events. The consensus of model results presented here is also consistent with recently detected changes in sea level pressure since the mid-nineteenth century.},

The SMOS instrument is a microwave interferometric radiometer which provides visibilities, from which brightness temperatures (TB) maps are reconstructed in the spacecraftâ antenna reference frame. In this study, we investigate how to improve the retrieval of salinity thanks to a better knowledge of the ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC). We show how both the SMOS bias correction (the so-called Ocean Target Transformation, OTT) and the half orbit TEC profile can be obtained from SMOS third Stokes parameter A3 using a location on the SMOS field of view (FOV) where the sensitivity of TB to TEC is highest. The resulting TEC global maps compare favorably with those built from the International Global navigation satellite system Service observations. TEC values obtained from A3 are next used to optimize the OTT estimation for every polarization, and proved to provide more stable values. Finally, improvements achieved in the salinity retrieved from SMOS data are reported.},

  abstract = {Climate modes, such as the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), influence Tropical Cyclones (TCs) interannual activity through their effect on large-scale atmospheric environment. These climate modes also induce interannual variations of subsurface oceanic stratification, which may also influence TCs. Changes in oceanic stratification indeed modulate the amplitude of TCs-induced cooling, and hence the negative feedback of air-sea interactions on the TC intensity. Here we use a dynamical downscaling approach that couples an axisymmetric TC model to a simple ocean model to quantify this interannual oceanic control on TC activity. We perform twin experiments with contrasted oceanic stratifications representative of interannual variability in each TC-prone region. While subsurface oceanic variations do not significantly affect the number of moderate (Category 3 or less) TCs, they do induce a 30% change of Category 5 TC-days globally, and a 70% change for TCs exceeding 85 m sâ1. TCs in the western Pacific and the southwestern Indian Ocean are most sensitive to oceanic interannual variability (with a â¼10 m sâ1 modulation of the intensity of strongest storms at low latitude), owing to large upper ocean variations in response to ENSO. These results imply that a representation of ocean stratification variability should benefit operational forecasts of intense TCs and the understanding of their climatic variability.},

  abstract = {[1] A 1/2Â° resolution global ocean general circulation model is used to investigate the processes controlling sea surface cooling in the wake of tropical cyclones (TCs). Wind forcing related to more than 3000 TCs occurring during the 1978-2007 period is blended with the CORE II interannual forcing, using an idealized TC wind pattern with observed magnitude and track. The amplitude and spatial characteristics of the TC-induced cooling are consistent with satellite observations, with an average cooling of â¼1Â°C that typically extends over 5 radii of maximum wind. A Wind power index (WPi) is used to discriminate cooling processes under TCs with high-energy transfer to the upper ocean (strong and/or slow cyclones) from the others (weak and/or fast cyclones). Surface heat fluxes contribute to â¼50 to 80% of the cooling for weak WPi as well as away from the cyclone track. Within 200 km of the track, mixing-induced cooling increases linearly with WPi, explaining â¼30% of the cooling for weak WPis and up to â¼80% for large ones. Mixing-induced cooling is strongly modulated by pre-storm oceanic conditions. For a given WPi, vertical processes can induce up to 8 times more cooling for shallow mixed layer and steep temperature stratification than for a deep mixed layer. Vertical mixing is the main source of rightward bias of the cold wake for weak and moderate WPi, but along-track advection becomes the main contributor to the asymmetry for the largest WPis.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] A plume of fresh water forms in the Atlantic due to discharge from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers and creates a stable barrier layer near the surface that is associated with warm sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs). The boreal summer atmospheric response to this sea surface temperature (SST) forcing is investigated using a regional atmospheric model. Results from two ensembles, one with the plume SSTA removed, and the other with an idealized plume SSTA imposed, reveal that the scale of the SSTA forcing is large enough to influence the summer climate over the tropical western Atlantic and Central America. Rainfall increases over the SSTAs and downstream over the Caribbean Sea and Central America, as sensible and latent heating associated with the plume SSTAs force a Rossby/Kelvin wave dynamical response. The result is westward shift by 12Â° of longitude of the North Atlantic subtropical anticyclone, a northward repositioning of the summertime subtropical anticyclone extension over the Gulf of Mexico, and increased moisture convergence into Central America. Warm SSTAs associated with the plume also influence simulated summer tropical Atlantic storms. The presence of the plume increases the number of Atlantic basin storms by 60% (i.e., 4.66 more storms). An increase in storm intensity also occurs, with a 61% increase of the number of storms that reach tropical storm and hurricane strength. However, these storms tend to be shorter lived and are associated with a 12% decrease in the number of tropical storm days. Storm trajectories also shift westward over the western Atlantic associated with the presence of the plume, bringing them closer to the U.S. coast as both the steering winds and vertical wind shear over the Atlantic are modified. These results suggest that the August storm systems may be more likely to track closer to the U.S. coast and/or over the Gulf of Mexico. Since the Amazon and Orinoco rivers are fed primarily by rainfall in the Amazon Basin during austral summer, the influence of the plume SSTs on Atlantic climate is an example of interhemispheric forcing of climate variability across seasons.},

  abstract = {We examine the variability of the sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Atlantic during 2005-2007 by using Argo profiling floats, Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Atlantic buoys and satellite, in situ, and atmospheric data sets. The eastern equatorial Atlantic, characterized by shallow mixed layers all yearlong, is divided into nine boxes of nearly equal surface area, with respect to the dynamics and thermodynamics in this region. Monthly mixed layer heat budgets are computed in each box from 10 day Argo profiles. In all the boxes, the net surface heat flux is one of the main causes of the seasonal evolution of sea surface temperatures for the 3 studied years. The amount of short-wave radiation penetrating through the base of the mixed layer and horizontal heat advection may locally contribute to the temperature variability, while entrainment has a weaker contribution. To balance the heat budget, a residual term exists which includes all processes that cannot be calculated with observations as well as the possible errors in the other terms. This residual is more intense in the cold tongue and the northern region and exhibits a clear seasonal cycle, with minimum (negative) values in boreal summer and maximum values in winter. This residual compares well with available observations of vertical turbulent mixing collected during Etude de la Circulation OcÃ©anique et des Ãchanges OcÃ©an-AtmosphÃ¨re dans le Golfe de Guinee campaigns (2005-2007) in the eastern equatorial Atlantic. When assuming that the residual is mostly associated with vertical turbulent mixing, it can be conjectured that turbulent mixing is a significant cooling source in the cold tongue and north of the equator.},

  Abstract                 = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission is aimed at monitoring, globally, surface soil moisture and sea surface salinity from radiometric L-band observations. The SMOS radiometer relies upon a two-dimensional (2-D) synthetic aperture concept in order to achieve satisfactory spatial resolution performances for a minimal cost in terms of payload mass and volume. Counterparts of this advantage are reduced radiometric sensitivity and increased complexity. The performances expected from SMOS, in terms of measurement accuracy, spatial resolution, and revisit time, depend on many parameters, among which several are crucial for assessing the payload and mission configurations. Most prominent among those configuration parameters are the flight altitude, the length of the interferometer arms, the spacing between radiating elements, and the tilt angle of the antenna plane. Their selection has to be optimized, so as to satisfy both scientific requirements and main technical constraints. This paper describes the way the optimization was carried out during the SMOS phase A. After assessing the main drivers on instrument configuration from the science requirements, the goal was to find an optimal trade-off, minimizing technical challenges while fulfilling the science objectives. It was found that, even though salinity retrievals are the most challenging, soil moisture retrievals were the most demanding in terms of mission definition and that a configuration exists to satisfy the required retrieval accuracies. The obtained configuration was then checked against ocean salinity retrievals and found satisfactory.},

A radiometric system using a 2-D interferometric design with multi-angular viewing capabilities will be borne by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) space mission. The basic rationale for retrieving soil moisture from radiometric measurements is the assumption that the surface layer can be modeled as a dielectric medium. Its dielectric constant then depends on several physical parameters, including soil moisture; emissivities for various incidence angles are computed using Fresnel's formulas. Many controlled field experiments have demonstrated the validity of this approach. Scenes exist however (e.g. ice covered or frozen surfaces, complete desert areas) where surface soil moisture is not a relevant concept. For such scenes, information should however be available on the complex dielectric constant itself. This communication describes a methodology which aims at retrieving in an optimized way the dielectric constant information available from multiangular radiometric data.},

  Abstract                 = {A general formulation of the electromagnetic propagation and scattering problem for rough surfaces is presented. The method is based on a decomposition of both the physical properties and the various electromagnetic field quantities associated with two media in terms of characteristic (or step) functions determined by the geometry. Maxwell equations are invoked and are interpreted in a generalized function (or distributional) sense. The results of the analysis are two coupled integral equations for the fields above and below the surface separating the media, together with a boundary condition. The boundary condition is generated as a by-product of the analysis. The integral equations are simplified by the use of a spatial Fourier transform. It is shown that when certain assumptions are made on the refractive index and spatial spectra of the surface profile and fields, an approximate solution of one integral equation may be obtained. This last result is of the same nature as the âsurface impedance\'e? boundary condition. Using the formulation, a series solution is proposed for the surface electric field in the spatial and temporal Fourier transform domain for a good conducting two dimensional periodic surface. The choice of a finite source is kept arbitrary. As an application of the series solution in ground wave propagation and scattering we have then considered the source to be an elementary vertical pulsed electric dipole. It is assumed that the surface slopes are small compared to unity. For this source, the zero-, first- and second-order approximations of the vertical component of the surface field are asymptotically transformed back into coordinate space. These solutions are in the form of ground waves with modified surface impedances.},

  abstract = {Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) variability from a hindcast run of an oceanic general circulation model (OGCM) forced by daily NCEP-NCAR reanalysis from 1990 to 2001 is analyzed. The purpose is to test the capability of the model in terms of the salinity simulation and provide insights for the future SSS observation from space. With daily forcing, the model can reproduce SSS change of the tropical Pacific on different time scales by comparing with the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) mooring observation. Our model results show that the western tropical Pacific is a large variability center on different time scales. On the interannual time scale, the standard deviation of SSS in the region could reach 0.5 practical salinity unit (psu). However, the eastern tropical Pacific shows relatively weak SSS variability (0.1 psu). On the intraannual time scale (60-360 days), the SSS variability in the western tropical Pacific is around 0.2 psu. The model SSS variability for the intraseasonal time scale (30-60 days) has a magnitude around 0.1 psu and tends to elongate along the latitudes of large meridional SSS gradient. On time scale shorter than 30 days, the model SSS variability center is near the equator and has a magnitude less than 0.1 psu. Relevance to the upcoming salinity satellite mission is discussed.},

  abstract = {Both Argo measurements and satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data revealed that there was less-than-usual surface cooling during the passage of typhoons Kaemi and Cimaron in the tropical Northwest Pacific. In the present study, it is found that SST cooling induced by typhoon can be greatly suppressed by a barrier layer with a thickness of 5-15 m. Such a barrier layer could reduce the entrainment cooling by 0.4-0.8 \B0C/d during typhoon passage, according to a diagnostic mixed layer model. The pre-existing barrier layer leads to a reduction in typhoon-induced surface cooling, and favors typhoon development. The average SST anomaly under barrier layer condition is 0.4-0.8\B0C less than that under no-barrier-layer condition. Due to the reduced cooling, the available maximum potential intensity (MPI) under barrier layer condition are higher 6 and 9.34 m/s than those under no-barrier-layer condition according to SST-dependent MPI formulation for Kaemi and Cimaron. In addition, the results from Price-Weller-Pinkel (PWP) model indicate that stratification due to salinity may significantly influence both entrainment and the upper ocean heat content during typhoon passage in the tropical Northwest Pacific.},

  abstract = {Random rough surfaces with slowly decaying power spectral density can have infinite slope variance. Such surfaces do not satisfy the classical curvature criterion for validity of the physical optics (PO) approximation, and the infinite frequency geometrical optics limit or specular point scattering model breaks down. We show for two-dimensional surfaces with infinite slope variance that the Gaussian form of the classical geometrical limit generalizes to a stable distribution function. We also show that the PO integral is insensitive to surface components with spatial frequency above a cutoff wavenumber, which explains past observations that PO can be accurate for surfaces with power law spectra. This result leads to a general validity condition for the PO approximation in the backscattering direction for power-law surfaces, which in the case of a k-4 spectrum requires that the significant slope of the surface be less than 0.03.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new method for continuously tracking the location of the Gulf Stream using a moored array of inverted echo sounders. Time series of lateral displacements of the front, shown accurate to Â± 8 km, have been collected along three sections spaced 100, 150, and 200 km downstream (NE) of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, for a period of 12 months. These records are highly coherent at all periodicities longer than 4 days. From the observed phase lags, a dispersion relationship is presented for the meanders: As the period and wavelength (T, Î») increase from (4 days, 180 km) to (30 days, 600 km), the phase speed decreases smoothly from 40 to 20 km dâ1. The meanders exhibited rapid growth at periods longer than 4 days, doubling in variance in each 50-km step downstream. This downstream growth is most appropriately described by a spatial e-folding scale Îºâ1 â¼400 km for (T, Î») â² (9 days, 300 km), and a temporal e-folding scale Ïâ1 â¼ 6 days for (T, Î») â³ (14 days, 400 km).},

  abstract = {A sea foam layer produced by wave breaking consists of seawater-coated air bubbles, fluid water, and air. The non-uniformity and microstructure of the air-water mixture in a foam layer can cause some important effects on microwave or optical properties. Considering the vertical non-uniformity of the air-water volume, the air-volume fraction is derived as a function of the foam depth variable, coated air bubble velocity, and foam temperature using the gas convection-diffusion equation. For a vertical graded profile of the air volume fraction, we discuss the effects of the coated air bubble velocity parameter and the air-sea temperature difference on the air volume fraction. The results show that the coated air bubble velocity is a key parameter that widely modulates the air volume fraction. Furthermore, an effective medium approximation (EMA) of spherical shell microstructures is proposed to investigate the graded foam effective permittivity and the emissivity of the sea surface covered with the foam layer of the graded air volume fraction in a vertical profile, and good agreement is obtained on comparing the EMA results with the experimental data of foam layer microwave emissivities at frequencies 1.4, 10.8, and 36.5 GHz. In our EMA model, the depth average of graded foam permittivity is adopted. This model can produce reasonable results by only tuning the air bubble velocity. It indicates that the EMA model can combine the effects of graded foam permittivity and foam microstructures into the coated air bubble velocity parameter. Meanwhile, we have qualitatively discussed the influence of air-sea temperature difference on the brightness temperature of the foam layer. It is shown that a negative (or positive) air-sea temperature difference enhances (or reduces) the sea surface brightness temperature, and the brightness temperature difference increases with an increase in microwave frequency.},

The two frequency microwave resonance technique has been employed using the NASA LaRC two frequency Scatterometer (at<tex>K_{u}</tex>-band) during the ARSLOE Experiment in November 1980.

These high altitude aircraft measurements of the modulation transfer function demonstrate a dependence on wavenumber, wind speed <span class='snippet'>and</span> sea state, <span class='snippet'>and</span> a gradual decrease with incidence angle.

  Abstract                 = {A new measurement program, to develop more precise relationships between the microwave (Ku-band) radar cross section and the ocean surface variables that affect the roughness and reflectivity, is in progress. An extensive data set was obtained during the Frontal Air-Sea Interaction Experiment (FASINEX) during the Winter of 1986 in the Atlantic south of Bermuda. Of interest in this study are the airborne Scatterometer measurements that were coincident with surface wind speed and stress measurements from aircraft and ships, and the directional surface wave spectrum. The airborne radar data set spans several different flights (typically at an altitude of 3000 feet) during which there were a variety of different atmospheric and ocean conditions. The RCS data is being correlated with these physical variables to create new and more general algorithms for remote sensing applications. This also includes a variety of radar parameters such as incidence angle of the radar beam, the polarization and a circular sweep of look direction relative to the wind vector.},

  abstract = {The use of satellite scatterometers to probe the winds in and near strong tropical cyclones (TCs) is a valuable tool for both numerical weather prediction and weather forecasters. The presence of widespread rain in these storms impedes the estimation of surface winds from the radar cross section measurements, when using a Ku-band radar. This paper seeks improvements in the methodology to infer surface winds and stresses from the satellite radar cross section data, by removing the effects of rain contamination at the ocean surface. The findings provide insights into improvements in the modeling efforts of TC intensity. This study demonstrates the use of high-resolution rain measurements obtained from a Next-Generation Radar collocated and simultaneous with the National Aeronautics and Space Ad ministration Quick Scatterometer. Through the application of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory/Hurricane Re search Division TC wind analysis (H* WIND), we are studying the dependence of a surface normalized radar cross section (NRCS), which is related to surface stress, on the TC wind speed and rain rate. One of our findings is that, in the three TCs we have studied, the highest winds are accompanied by significant rain. Another is that the wind-driven rain can act as a roughening effect as measured by the H-pol NRCS. We also offer reasons why this can be interpreted as an additional stress on the surface. This roughening affects both the estimation of surface winds by scatterometers and the air-sea energy exchanges. This information could lead to an improved understanding of the dependence of the drag coefficient on both wind and rain.},

Preliminary results in NRCS caused by rain, relative to that in nearby regions with negligible rain shows distinct characteristics. Three regions with different wind speeds (4-6, 6-8 and 8-10 m/s) show definitive variation of this total NRCS with respect to wind magnitude, satellite-relative wind direction, polarization and rainrate. Relative changes are stronger in the lower wind region for both polarizations, with H-pol providing a more definitive signature. At higher wind speeds (e.g. 10 m/s) the relative splash induced increases in NRCS are still significant, and show distinct differences between polarizations.},

This is in addition to wind driven roughness, atmospheric scattering, and attenuation that affect the measured normalized radar cross section (NRCS). This paper presents a case study of the increase of the total radar cross section, averaged across surface illuminated areas (individual footprints) of the SeaWinds scatterometer (on QuikSCAT) caused by rain striking the sea surface. This effort combines satellite-based K<sub>u</sub>-band data with high-resolution 3-<span class='snippet'>D</span> volumetric rain measurements, from simultaneous collocated Next Generation Weather Radar data. The results to be presented were acquired during a significant rain event in the Gulf of Mexico, to the east of Corpus Christi, and just south of Houston, TX, in May 2005. The results of this paper show dependence on wind speed, rainrate, and polarization. They agree with numerous surface-based studies (single point measurements), using ocean platforms and wind-wave tanks, whose data were collected under similar conditions. For example, at rainrates less than 10 mm/hr, the relative change in surface roughness is seen to decrease as the wind magnitude increases from 5 to 7 m/s. Another consistent observation is that the vertical polarization NRCS shows less sensitivity to rainrate than does horizontal.},

Studies are in progress to evaluate the effect of rain-induced sea surface roughness on the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) measured by the SeaWinds satellite radar on the QuikSCAT (QSCAT) satellite. In order to accomplish the wind measurement, the effect of attenuation and scattering by the atmospheric rain must be removed. The QSCAT NRCS data is collocated in space and time with the TRMM satellite, in the neighborhood of an NDBC buoy, to permit the calculation and removal of the contribution from the atmospheric precipitation. The buoy wind speed and direction provides critical information on the impact of this effect on the operational performance of this instrument, and to assist with other comparisons. Vertical profiles of the atmospheric water content and reflectivity are available from the TRMM sensors. The buoy winds are essential to estimate the nominal surface NRCS that is augmented by the rain-splash contribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Coincident measurements with a 37-GHz polarimetric radiometer and a 10-GHz scatterometer during the Coastal Ocean Probing Experiment (COPE) in September and October of 1995 offered a unique opportunity to compare their relative sensitivity and performance in observing sea surface winds. The scatterometer cross section so and the radiometer's second and third Stokes parameters, Q and U, were measured. The dependence of the angular signature of the radiometer on friction velocity was investigated by combining the COPE data with data collected in the Labrador Sea in February and March of 1997 at higher wind speeds than were encountered during COPE. The results of these experiments showed that the first harmonics of the radiometer azimuthal response were relatively insensitive to the friction velocity but that their second harmonics increased rapidly in amplitude with increasing friction velocity, with approximately the same sensitivity as a scatterometer cross section. The sensitivity of the radar and radiometer to the wind direction were then compared by computing the ratio of the angular signal to the inherent variability of the measurements for both instruments, their variability ratio. These ratios were comparable for the radar and radiometer and both increased with wind speed. However, the variability ratio of the radiometer decreased with increasing incidence angle while that of the radar increased. The similar magnitudes of the variability ratios of the two instruments are interpreted by the authors to indicate that their azimuthal signatures are caused by the same geophysical process: the angular dependence of short waves on the ocean surface and their tilting by longer waves. Their different dependence on incidence angle ui is explained as a result of the fact that partial derivative sigma (o)/partial derivative theta (i) decreases with increasing incidence angle, while partial derivativeQ/partial derivative theta (i) and partial derivativeU/partial derivative theta (i) increase with incidence angle.},

Continuous radar cross section measurements (one second averages) and spatially coincident, simultaneous sonic anemometer measurements of the 3 wind components provide the first known coherence function for frequencies from 0.0005 to 0.5 Hz. Unexpectedly, the wind fluctuations above 0.01 Hz do not induce correlated surface roughness variations, as observed by L, S, X and Ka-band radars. Only below 0.01 Hz, and only for X-band and Ka-band roughness scales do the authors measure coherences above 0.5. These results indicate that the short waves are only correlated with the wind on scales of 10s of minutes. Therefore one cannot assume that these short sea waves receive their energy directly from the wind, and one must identify a wave generating mechanism for these centimeter waves based on hydrodynamic interactions},

  Abstract                 = {We derive a relatively simple, yet accurate, relationship between the microwave brightness temperature of the ocean and conventional oceanographic and meteorological parameters. To begin with, the brightness temperature of the ocean and the intervening atmosphere is expressed in terms of integrals for the radiative scattering and emission from the sea surface and the radiative absorption and emission by the atmosphere. We then find closed-form approximations for these integrals and obtain a simplified model for the radiative transfer and scattering. The model is reduced to a function giving brightness temperature in terms of five variables: sea-surface temperature, sea-surface friction velocity, atmospheric columnar water vapor content, atmospheric columnar liquid water content, and surface air temperatureÂ« In the derivation of the model, the absorption coefficient for rain clouds and the wind-induced sea-surface emissivity are found from SEASAT SMMR observations. The remainder of the derivation is based on wellaccepted microwave theory. The model function is referenced to the five frequencies and 49Â° incidence angle at which the SEASAT and Nimbus 7 SMMR operate. When compared with the more precise integral formulation, the model function accuracy is 0.2 K at 6.6 GHz and gradually degrades to 2.1 K at 37 GHz, horizontal polarization. These accuracies are an average over an ensemble of winds and atmospheres ranging from a specular surface and clear skies to a 21 m/s wind and a very heavy cloud layer containing 60 mg/cm2 of liquid water, but excluding rain. An uncertainty of about 10% in the wind-induced emissivity introduces some additional error into the model function. Several of the derived model parameters are compared with values obtained in other experiments and theoretical investigations. The frequency ratios of the SMMR-inferred absorption coefficients for rain clouds are in very close agreement with that given by Mie scattering theory. The large-scale sea-surface slope variance found from the SMMR data is consistent with the slope variance computed from a sea wave spectrum, with that inferred from microwave scatterometer measurements at nadir, and with the Cox and Munk value deduced from sun glitter. The SMMR-inferred foam coverage correlates better with whitecap coverage than streak coverage, indicating that the increase in brightness temperature due to sea foam is more a result of whitecapping than streaking. A layered dielectric model for sea foam predicts the same frequency and polarization variation in the foam reflectivity as observed by the SMMR. The consistency of these results support the premise that the sea-surface emissivity is accurately represented by a composite model in which the emission from the rough, foam-free water is given by twoscale scattering theory and the foam emission is given by a layered dielectric theory.},

  Abstract                 = {The forward scattering of microwave solar radiation from a smooth and from a rough water surface is computed. The smooth surface is assumed specular, and the rough surface is represented by a two-scale surface, for which two small-scale perturbation parameters, 0.10 and 0.25, are considered. The contribution of the scattered sunlight to the antenna temperature is found using the scalar approximation, and the results are compared with radiometer measurements of the Cape Cod Canal. The overall agreement is good, but in some cases the smooth-surface measurements are higher than the computations. This discrepancy possibly indicates an absolute calibration error or a slight misalignment of the antennas' boresights. The computations for the two perturbation parameters bracket the rough-surface measurements except when the sun's mirror image is far removed from the boresight direction. The small disagreement in this case may be due to a peaked large-scale slope distribution.},

Microwaves penetrate clouds with little attenuation, giving an uninterrupted view of the ocean surface. This is a distinct advantage over infrared measurements of SST, which are obstructed by clouds. Comparisons with ocean buoys show a root mean square difference of about 0.6Â°C, which is partly due to the satellite-buoy spatial-temporal sampling mismatch and the difference between the ocean skin temperature and bulk temperature. Microwave SST retrievals provide insights in a number of areas, including tropical instability waves, marine boundary layer dynamics, and the prediction of hurricane intensity.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of turbulent ocean mixing transcends its inherently small scales to affect large scale ocean processes including water-mass transformation, stratification maintenance, and the overturning circulation. However, the distribution of ocean mixing is not well described by sparse ship-based observations since this mixing is both spatially patchy and temporally intermittent. We use strain information from Argo float profiles in the upper 2,000 m of the ocean to generate over 400,000 estimates of the energy dissipation rate, indicative of ocean mixing. These estimates rely on numerous assumptions, and do not take the place of direct measurement methods. Temporally averaged estimates reveal clear spatial patterns in the parameterized dissipation rate and diffusivity distribution across all the oceans. They corroborate previous observations linking elevated dissipation rates to regions of rough topography. We also observe heightened estimated dissipation rates in areas of high eddy kinetic energy, as well as heightened diffusivity in high latitudes where stratification is weak. The seasonal dependence of mixing is observed in the Northwest Pacific, suggesting a wind-forced response in the upper ocean.},

  Abstract                 = {The Shannon entropy is a measure of the degree of intricacy contained in any graphable n-dimensional realization of an observable quantity. We use the Shannon entropy to measure the intricacy of density overturns in the oceanic thermocline and find that the Shannon entropy is related to the Thorpe scale LT [Thorpe, 1977] and the Ozmidov scale LO [Ozmidov, 1965]. We find that (1) small Shannon entropy corresponds to small values of ROT (â¡LO/LT), while large Shannon entropy is associated with large values of ROT; (2) density spectra are typically more steep than inertial subrange spectra when both Shannon entropy and ROT are small, whereas the spectral slope tends to be flatter than inertial subrange spectra when both Shannon entropy and ROT are large; (3) the Grashof number is very large (O(1010)) when Shannon entropy is small, indicating that these patches are extremely density unstable; (4) spectral bandwidth is much larger for patches with small Shannon entropy than for those with large entropy, indicating that large-scale, or âbulkâ Reynolds number is large when entropy is small. We discuss the hypothesis that the degree of intricacy, and hence the Shannon entropy, increases with increasing time in a turbulent overturn and is observed to decrease only when the resolution limits of the measuring system are exceeded. On the basis of these arguments we suggest that some classes of overturns are created with Thorpe scale larger than the Ozmidov scale. In these overturns the kinetic energy dissipation rate (Îµ) is small during the initial growth of the overturn. Later, a small-scale structure develops, and a more complex, higher-order flow evolves. This behavior is discussed and compared with gridgenerated laboratory turbulence, in which initially small, energetic, rapidly growing boundary layers detached from the grid and advect downstream, forcing ROT to be largest adjacent to the grid and thereafter decrease as a result of entrainment.},

  Abstract                 = {Microstructure measurements in the equatorial Pacific at 140Â°W in late 1984 show a pronounced diurnal variation in both high-frequency internal wave energy and kinetic energy dissipation rate. Observations indicated that after sunset, internal waves (presumably generated by convective overturns in the mixed layer) propagate downward and increase turbulence levels in the pycnocline. It is proposed that large mixed layer eddies in the South Equatorial Current interact with the large shear caused by the Equatorial Undercurrent to generate a westward going anisotropic wave field. The momentum transport in the radiated wave field results in a drag force on the equatorial mean flow field. The observed mean wind stress at 140Â°W during Tropic Heat I (which is twice as large as the annual mean wind) is closer to the estimated radiation stress (â¼â10â4 m2 sâ2) at the base of the mixed layer (â30 m) than to the estimated turbulent stress (â¼â10â5 m2 sâ2). A wave dissipation model based on the observed turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate is introduced in order to estimate the wave momentum flux divergence in the stratified region above the undercurrent core. The model predicts that most of the downward wave momentum flux penetrates through the undercurrent core. It is hypothesized that when the wind stress is strong, the equatorial Pacific Ocean responds by generating a westward traveling internal wave field which transports much of the surface wind stress below the actively mixing surface layer.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of a rain-produced, fresh surface anomaly observed in the western equatorial Pacific warm pool was modeled by use of the Princeton Ocean Model with Mellor-Yamada turbulent closure. The simulation was forced by a wind stress of 0.12 N mâ2 and surface cooling of 225 W mâ2. Following spin-up, 34-mm average rainfall was applied over a small portion of the domain. When rainfall ceased, momentum was trapped in a 1-m, fresh surface layer, and turbulent mixing was inhibited below the layer. Seven hours later, the surface density anomaly was reduced by an order of magnitude, and the surface velocity anomaly in the direction of the wind was 0.15 m sâ1. The simulations show upwelling at the upwind edge of the anomaly and downwelling at the downwind edge with maxima of 15 and 35 m dâ1, respectively. The momentum balance for the velocity component in the direction of the wind indicated that local acceleration, horizontal advection, and vertical diffusion were in approximate balance except at the downwind edge of the anomaly, where pressure gradient terms were also important. The budget of turbulent kinetic energy showed that shear production plus buoyancy production (or destruction) was approximately balanced by dissipation in much of the anomaly; advection and vertical turbulent transport terms were significant at some depths at the edges. The strength of the surface density front at the downwind edge of the anomaly tended to increase with time relative to the front at the upwind edge.},

  Abstract                 = {This study focuses on upper ocean budgets of heat and freshwater, which yield estimates of net surface heat flux and rainfall minus evaporation. The budgets are based on a 19 day ship survey conducted as part of the Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate Processes in the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere System 2001 in September 2001. Underway measurements included temperature and salinity sections from an undulating platform, SeaSoar, and horizontal currents from an acoustic Doppler current profiler along a 146 Ã 146 km survey pattern centered near 10Â°N, 95Â°W in the eastern Pacific warm pool. Additional measurements from a second ship at the center of the survey pattern included radar backscatter from rainfall, air-sea fluxes, and vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, microstructure, and horizontal velocity. Satellite measurements of surface height, temperature, and rainfall were also analyzed. The heat budget of 20 and 25 m surface layers indicated that storage, advection, turbulent transport, and penetrative solar radiation were all significant components of the heat budget with a net surface cooling of 41 W mâ2 estimated as a residual, which agreed with atmospheric measurements (30 W mâ2). The precipitation rate from the freshwater budget was 29 mm dâ1, which was in excellent agreement with in situ measurements on both ships and in good agreement with satellite estimates for the same period. Lateral transports of heat and salt were influenced by an anticyclonic eddy in the survey area, and it is suggested that anticyclonic eddies, which form near the Central American coast, may carry anomalously warm sea surface temperature toward the west and become preferential sites for heavy rainfall.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of the JPL Wind Radiometer program is to develop and demonstrate low cost instruments for remotely measuring ocean wind vectors from space. The microwave emission from the ocean surface is elliptically polarized and the degree of polarization and angle is a function of the surface wind speed and direction. JPL has developed a set of microwave polarimetric radiometers at 19 and 37 GHz (WINDRAD), which have been used on the NASA DC-8 aircraft for remote measurements of ocean surface wind vectors. A summary of all the ocean polarimetric data vs. wind speed and incidence angle from three flights in 1994 and eight flights in 1995 is presented. These data show clear wind direction signals at wind speeds from 3 to 24 m/s and incidence angles of 45Â° to 65},

Because the L-band brightness temperatures associated with salinity changes are expected to be small, it was necessary to build a very sensitive and stable system. This new instrument has dual-frequency, dual polarization radiometer and radar sensors. The antenna is a high beam efficiency conical horn. The PALS instrument was installed on the NCAR C-130 aircraft and soil moisture measurements were made in support of the Southern Great Plains 1999 experiment in Oklahoma from July 8-14, 1999. Data taken before and after a rainstorm showed significant changes in the brightness temperatures, polarization ratios and radar backscatter, as a function of soil moisture. Salinity measurement missions were flown on July 17-19, 1999, southeast of Norfolk, VA, over the Gulf Stream. The measurements indicated a clear and repeatable salinity signal during these three days, which was in good agreement with the Cape Hatteras ship salinity data. Data were also taken in the open ocean and a small decrease of 0.2 K was measured in the brightness temperature, which corresponded to the salinity increase of 0.4 psu measured by the M/V Oleander vessel},

The zerothâorder iterate is shown to be equivalent to the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) and the extent to which higherâorder iterates provide corrections to the KA is examined by numerical comparison with reference solutions. An ETâbased iterate of low order is shown to greatly improve the KA solution in almost the entire lowâtoâmedium wavenumber region provided: (a) the angle of incidence (with respect to the normal to the average plane of the corrugated surface, assumed to be a sinusoid in the computations) of the impinging plane wave is not too close, and, in any case, inferior to the shadowing angle, and (b) the amplitude of the corrugation does not exceed one tenth of the corrugation period. These improvements are obtained at the expense of a quite modest volume of computations},

  abstract = {Several proposed near-future spaceborne radar missions, such as the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and TerraSAR, will include an L-band instrument. At such low frequencies, the Faraday rotation in the ionosphere, which rotates the polarization plane of the radar signal, becomes an important consideration in instrument design. In this paper, both simple analytic approximations and numerical models are used to derive likely values of Faraday rotation and determine their impact on polarimetric imagery and derived products. One-way rotations exceeding 5 deg; are likely to significantly reduce the accuracy of geophysical parameter recovery, such as forest biomass. On average, Faraday rotation can be neglected at solar minimum, but correction methods are needed at other times of the solar cycle and under disturbed conditions. Methods for implementing such corrections based on estimates of the Faraday rotation and prerotation of the transmitted signal are described.},

  Abstract                 = {This work has been conducted in the framework of several projects devoted to assess the performance of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission full-pol measurement mode. Since its launch in November 2009, SMOS is producing dual-polarization brightness temperature synthesized images that are yielding a high scientific return. However, these images are affected by a non-negligible spatial amplitude error, the so-called spatial bias (SB), that degrades geophysical parameter retrieval. This effect is particularly detrimental in SMOS polarimetric images where spatial bias is masking the polarimetric physical signature to a large extend. This paper presents a method to mitigate SMOS spatial bias by taking into account the co- and cross-polar antenna patterns in the image reconstruction algorithm through the, so called, full-pol G-matrix (FPG). The method is validated by producing spatial bias maps out of the comparison between SMOS full-pol images and an accurate polarimetric brightness temperature model of the ocean. This model has been provided to SMOS ESLs (Expert Support Laboratories) by LOCEAN (Laboratoire d'OcÃ©anographie et du Climat, France) as a test bench to validate and improve SMOS Level 1 (L1) data. Finally, a radiometric performance summary table comparing spatial bias and radiometric sensitivity between this new FPG approach and SMOS current co-polar G-matrix approach (CPG) is provided. This paper presents the best quality SMOS polarimetric images, which may lead a breakthrough in the science returns of the mission.},

To estimate the rate of upwelling, the mass, heat and salt budgets of the tongue are investigated. The Ekman divergence is determined from wind stress as 84 ? 106 m3 s?1. It is compensated by geostrophic convergence of the same magnitude as determined from the zonal pressure gradient. Since the vertical distribution of the two meridional flows is different, a strong vertical circulation results, which leads to upwelling at a rate of ?50 ? 106 m3 s?1. A consideration of the heat budget leads to the conclusion that horizontal advection in the South Equatorial Current does contribute to the cool tongue, but that the contribution of upwelling is much larger. The heat budget also indicates that upwelling comes from depths above the core of the undercurrent and that the source water has temperatures only ?3Â°C less than the water flowing out laterally. The seasonal variation of all properties associated with the cool tongue is strong and produces a cross-equatorial flow of water from the summer to the winter hemisphere of ?20 ? 106 m3 s?16.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Sea level records at many island and coastal stations in the equatorial Pacific Ocean have been used to study its response and that of the associated equatorial circulation to the 1972 El NiÃ±o. The response can be divided into five phases. Preceding El NiÃ±o, stronger than normal equatorial trade winds cause a buildup of sea level in the western Pacific in 1970 and 1971. After the wind strength peaks, sea level begins to drop slowly in the western Pacific. The first collapse of the wind field is followed by high sea level along the eastern border of the ocean, actually initiating El NiÃ±o off Peru. The initial oceanic response seems to consist of an equatorial Kelvin wave, which has been successfully modeled by others, and a strong reduction of the South Equatorial Current. During the third phase sea level drops very rapidly in the western Pacific, the equatorial trough is being filled, the South Equatorial Current retreats to the south of the equator, and the Countercurrent intensifies. Then follows a second peak of sea level along the eastern side of the ocean including the coast of Central America and extremely low sea level in the western Pacific. Thereafter, conditions return to normal, and sea level changes are even more rapid than at the onset of El NiÃ±o. The development of a weaker event in 1975 is also analyzed, and it is shown that such an event terminates after the second phase.

Largest annual fluctuations are associated with the equatorial current system and are probably due to vertical displacements of the thermocline in response to the changing wind field. In the subtropical gyres and in higher latitudes, dynamic topography varies seasonally in response to the annual cycle of surface layer temperature, but the pattern of dynamic height does not change much between summer and winter. In the western portion of the North Pacific anticyclonic gyre, a U-shaped ridge is developed with its open end pointing east, which separates the western boundary current from the interior of the gyre and links the north equatorial ridge with a ridge at the right flank of the Kuroshio. The variability of dynamic height given by its standard deviation increases from east to west across the Pacific Ocean. Most of this variability is due to fluctuations in the position of currents, their meandering, and the presence of eddies.

  Abstract                 = {Observations of surface drift currents made by merchant ships are used to calculate the kinetic energy of the mean flow as well as the kinetic energy of the fluctuations, which is interpreted as eddy kinetic energy. The distribution of these properties is charted for the North Atlantic Ocean based on 1Â° squares and for the world oceans based on 5Â° squares. Both distributions show essentially the same features, namely, high values in the western boundary currents and in the equatorial current system and low values in the subtropical gyres. The ratio between mean energy and eddy energy is high (about 1 to 2) in the strong currents and low (about 1/20 to 1/40) in the central and eastern portions of the gyres. Comparing mean and eddy energies in ocean and atmosphere, it becomes apparent that eddy energies in the two systems are uncorrelated. The results are consistent with the idea that eddy motion in the ocean is generated in areas of strong mean shear flow and is subsequently distributed over the whole ocean.},

  Abstract                 = {For low-frequency (UHF/VHF, P and L band) spaceborne SAR systems, the ionospheric effects are the most significant problems. In this paper, the preliminary investigation of a technique aiming at using TEC information derived from PolSAR data to reduce the ionospheric effects was implemented and the TEC derivation was verified with six quad polarized ALOS/PALSAR data sets. In addition, the behaviour of Faraday rotation estimation from quad polarized ALOS/PALSAR data was evaluated as the pre-requisite step of the above technique by comparing with the GPS based true TEC data sets over different areas. The experiment shows that the TEC information can be derived from the quad-pol data reasonably over mid-latitude area.},

  Abstract                 = {The blended monthly sea surface salinity (SSS) analysis, called the NOAA âBlended Analysis of Surface Salinityâ (BASS), is constructed for the 4 year period from 2010 to 2013. Three data sets are employed as inputs to the blended analysis: in situ SSS measurements aggregated and quality controlled by NOAA/NODC, and passive microwave (PMW) retrievals from both the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Aquarius/SAC-D and the European Space Agency's (ESA) Soil Moisture-Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites. The blended analysis comprises two steps. First, the biases in the satellite retrievals are removed through probability distribution function (PDF) matching against temporally spatially colocated in situ measurements. The blended analysis is then achieved through optimal interpolation (OI), where the analysis for the previous time step is used as the first guess while the in situ measurements and bias-corrected satellite retrievals are employed as the observations to update the first guess. Cross validations illustrate improved quality of the blended analysis, with reduction in bias and random errors over most of the global oceans as compared to the individual inputs. Large uncertainty, however, remains in high-latitude oceans and coastal regions where the in situ networks are sparse and current-generation satellite retrievals have limitations. Our blended SSS analysis shows good agreements with the NODC in situ-based analysis over most of the tropical and subtropical oceans, but large differences are observed for high-latitude oceans and along coasts. In the tropical oceans, the BASS is shown to have coherent variability with precipitation and evaporation associated with the evolution of the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).},

  abstract = {Bistatic scattering and emissivities of surfaces with exponential correlation functions are studied numerically for 2-D geometries in a numerical Maxwell model with 2-D simulations. Surfaces with exponential correlation functions are important for the active and passive microwave remote sensing of land surfaces. Because of the fine-scale features with large slopes of such surfaces, numerical accuracy, which is particularly important for the calculation of emissivity in passive remote sensing, is ensured by a variety of procedures in this paper. The rooftop function and Galerkin's method with numerical integration of near-field impedance matrix elements are used. Cubic spline interpolation is employed to connect knots on random rough surfaces. Numerical accuracy convergence tests are performed for numerical solutions of Maxwell equations by varying the number of points from 13 to 103 points per wavelength in the dielectric medium corresponding to 50-400 points per free wavelength. Surface lengths of up to 100 and 200 free wavelengths and root mean square heights of up to 0.4 and 0.8 free wavelengths, respectively, are used at 5 and 10 GHz to capture all the essential features. Because of the large number of surface unknowns (up to 80 000), the multilevel UV method is further used to accelerate the matrix equation solver. Numerical results are illustrated for both bistatic scattering and emissivities as functions of frequencies and incidence and scattering angles for cases of interests in microwave remote sensing. Comparisons are made with the second-order small perturbation method and Kirchhoff's approximation to reestablish the regimes of validity of these methods},

  Abstract                 = {AbstractSubsurface salinity anomalies propagating between mid- and low latitudes along isopycnal surfaces have been shown to play an important role in modulating ocean and climate variability. In this study, a sustained freshening and southwestward propagation of subsurface salinity anomalies in the northwest Pacific subtropical gyre and its dynamical mechanism are investigated using observations, numerical outputs, and a predictive model. Analyses of the observations show a pronounced subsurface freshening with salinity decreasing about 0.25 PSU near the 24.5-ÃÂ? surface in the northwest Pacific subtropical gyre during 2003?11. This freshening is found to be related to the surface forcing of salinity anomalies in the outcrop zone (25ÃÂ°?35ÃÂ°N, 130ÃÂ°?160ÃÂ°E). A predictive model based on the assumption of salinity conservation along the outcrop isopycnals is derived and used to examine this surface-forcing mechanism. The resemblance between the spatial structures of the subsurface salinity derived from the predictive model and from observations and numerical outputs suggests that subsurface salinity anomalies are ventilated over the outcrop zone. A salinity anomaly with an amplitude of about 0.25 PSU generated by the surface forcing is subducted in the outcrop zone and then propagates southwestward, accompanied by potential vorticity anomalies, to the east of Luzon Strait (~15ÃÂ°N) in roughly one year. When the anomalies reach 15ÃÂ°N, they turn and move gradually eastward toward the central Pacific, associated with an eastward countercurrent on the southern subtropical gyre.

Assuming that variations of the main thermocline depth (MTD) are slow (the change of the MTD over one wavelength is smaller than the wave amplitude), wave reflections can be neglected and the amplitudes of equatorially trapped waves can be derived by using the energy conservation law. It is found that the wavelengths and amplitudes of free waves are significantly modified by the MTD variations. While propagating eastward in an ocean basin (where the MTD is shallower), Kelvin waves shrink meridionally and zonally but their amplitudes increase to preserve wave energy; short Rossby waves behave in the opposite way. The wavelength of westward-propagating long Rossby waves becomes longer when they propagate into the deeper western ocean.

A period of three months from November 1st, 2011 to January 31st, 2012 is selected to assess the forecast skill of the assimilation system. 24h-forecasts and longer forecasts are based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm), and the assimilation is performed by a localized Singular Evolutive Interpolated Kalman (LSEIK) filter. For comparison, the assimilation is repeated only with the SSMIS sea ice concentrations. By running two different assimilation experiments, and comparing with the unassimilated model, independent satellite derived data, and in-situ observation, it is shown that the SMOS ice thickness assimilation leads to improved thickness forecasts. With SMOS thickness data, the sea ice concentration forecasts also agree better with observations, although this improvement is smaller.},

Inverse analysis of SSS in the Bay of Bengal also indicates that the monthly mean rainfall of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) is more consistent with SSS and river runoff data than other precipitation climatologies.},

It was found that the model TEC values are systematically less than those obtained experimentally by about 3.10 16 m -2 . It was shown that the rms deviation of the experimental data from the model shows almost linear dependence on the F10.7 index. The relative errors of IRI-2001 and IRI-2007 have significant 11-year and annual variations. The relative error of IRI-2001 against the altimeter data is less than 40% in 69% of the measurements and of IRI-2007, in 67% of the measurements.

  Abstract                 = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, launched in November 2009, carries the first interferometric radiometer at L-band (1.4 GHz) in orbit. Over the open ocean and for moderate wind speeds (WSs), the SMOS brightness temperatures (TB) are at first order consistent with simulated TB of theoretical prelaunch models implemented in the European Space Agency Level 2 Ocean Salinity processor. However, we found large discrepancies between measurements and model simulations when WS is above 12 $hbox{ms}^{-1}$ . A new set of parameters for a sea wave spectrum and a foam coverage model that can be used for simulating L-band radiometer data over a large range of WS is proposed based on the deduced wind-induced components from the SMOS data. The quality of the SMOS retrieved sea surface salinity (SSS) with the new emissivity model is estimated by comparing it with the World Ocean Atlas 2005 climatological SSS and the Array for Real-Time Geostrophic Oceanography (ARGO) SSS.},

  abstract = {Abstract The wind speed (WS) provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is used to initialize the retrieval process of \{WS\} and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) obtained by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. This process compensates for the lack of onboard instrument providing a measure of ocean surface \{WS\} independent of the L-band radiometer measurements. The SMOS-retrieved \{WS\} in the center of the swath (Â±&} # xa0;300& #{xa0;km) is adjusted regarding to its a priori estimate. The quality of the SMOS-retrieved \{SSS\} (SSSSMOS) is better at the center of the swath than at the edge of the swatch because the larger number of brightness temperature measurements available at the center of the swath reduces the effects of noise and because the greater variety of incidence angles provides more scope for adjusting the WS. This highlights the advantage of using a multi-parameter retrieval with respect to a SSS-only retrieval in which the \{WS\} would be entirely prescribed. Systematic inconsistencies between the atmospheric \{WS\} modeled using \{ECMWF\} and the \{WS\} sensed by radiometers are observed. These inconsistencies in the \{WS\} are reduced by the retrieval scheme but they still lead to residual biases in the SSSSMOS, especially in the eastern equatorial Pacific ocean if the \{ECMWF\} \{WS\} is used as an a priori estimate.},

  Abstract                 = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission carries the Microwave Imaging Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) instrument. It is the first time that an interferometric radiometer is in orbit. The objective of this paper is to assess the quality of the brightness temperatures (TBs) derived from this novel instrument, as processed with the SMOS operational chain at the end of the SMOS commissioning phase. Extensive comparisons have been conducted between reconstructed TBs derived from MIRAS measurements (MIRAS TB) and TBs simulated using the default radiative transfer model implemented in the European Space Agency SMOS ocean salinity processor and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast forcings. At first order, the North-South variability of MIRAS TB due to geophysical variations of temperature, salinity, and wind speed over the ocean is consistent with the simulated L-band signal, and the standard deviation of the MIRAS TB minus the model simulations is close to the theoretical radiometric resolution. On the other hand, biases of several Kelvins, that depend on the location in the field of view, are observed between averaged MIRAS TB and simulations. After these biases are removed, the North-South gradient of sea surface salinity is well sensed by MIRAS except at high wind speed.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the angular properties of plane waves backscattered from random fractal curves and surfaces (diffractals). For this purpose we apply the physical optics (Kirchhoff) approximation without resorting to the high-frequency limit. The fractals of interest are described by Gaussian random processes possessing power-law spectra with and without a large-scale cutoff. We show that if the wavelength of the incident field is of order of the topothesy, small variations of its value may alter the angular pattern of the backscattered power qualitatively. The most important prediction is a peak which Kirchhoff diffractals exhibit under specific conditions at a particular angle of incidence. The position of the peak is linked to the dimension of the topothesy and provides a good possibility for experimental measurement of these intrinsic parameters of the fractal surfaces. The effect of large-scale cut-off which determines the RMS height of the surface is also studied.},

  abstract = {Aquarius observations featured a prominent zonal sea-surface salinity (SSS) front that extended across the tropical Pacific between 2-\9310\B0N. By linking to Argo subsurface salinity observations and satellite-derived surface forcing datasets, the study discovered that the SSS front was not a stand-alone feature, but, in fact, the surface manifestation of a shallow low-salinity convergence zone (LSCZ). A near-surface salinity budget analysis was conducted, showing that the LSCZ was sourced from the rainfall in the Inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), but the mechanism of its generation and maintenance was dominated by the wind-driven Ekman dynamics, not the surface freshwater flux.Three distinct features highlighted the relationship between the LSCZ and ITCZ. The first was that the seasonal movement of the LSCZ was characterized by a monotonic northward displacement starting from the near-equatorial latitudes in boreal spring, which was different from the ITCZ that is known for its seasonal north-south displacement. The second feature was that the lowest SSS waters were locked to the northern edge of the Ekman salt convergence throughout the year, but they showed no fixed relationship with the ITCZ rain band. The LSCZ and ITCZ collocated only during August-October, the time that the ITCZ rain band coincided with the Ekman convergence zone. The third feature was the evidence of the collocation between the SSS front and the Ekman convergence zone, which not only established the Ekman convergence as the genesis of the LSCZ but also positioned the SST front as a surface manifestation of the LSCZ.},

  abstract = {Ocean evaporation (E) and precipitation (P) are the fundamental components of the global water cycle. They are also the freshwater flux forcing (i.e., E-P) for the open ocean salinity. The apparent connection between ocean salinity and the global water cycle leads to the proposition of using the oceans as a rain gauge. However, the exact relationship between E-P and salinity is governed by complex upper ocean dynamics, which may complicate the inference of the water cycle from salinity observations. To gain a better understanding of the ocean rain gauge concept, here we address a fundamental issue as to how E-P and salinity are related on the seasonal timescales. A global map that outlines the dominant process for the mixed-layer salinity (MLS) in different regions is thus derived, using a lower-order MLS dynamics that allows key balance terms (i.e., E-P, the Ekman and geostrophic advection, vertical entrainment, and horizontal diffusion) to be computed from satellite-derived data sets and a salinity climatology. Major E-P control on seasonal MLS variability is found in two regions: the tropical convergence zones featuring heavy rainfall and the western North Pacific and Atlantic under the influence of high evaporation. Within this regime, E-P accounts for 40-70% MLS variance with peak correlations occurring at 2-4 month lead time. Outside of the tropics, the MLS variations are governed predominantly by the Ekman advection, and then vertical entrainment. The study suggests that the E-P regime could serve as a window of opportunity for testing the ocean rain gauge concept once satellite salinity observations are available.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study investigated the accuracy and physical representation of air?sea surface heat flux estimates for the Indian Ocean on annual, seasonal, and interannual time scales. Six heat flux products were analyzed, including the newly developed latent and sensible heat fluxes from the Objectively Analyzed Air?Sea Heat Fluxes (OAFlux) project and net shortwave and longwave radiation results from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), the heat flux analysis from the Southampton Oceanography Centre (SOC), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis 1 (NCEP1) and reanalysis-2 (NCEP2) datasets, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts operational (ECMWF-OP) and 40-yr Re-Analysis (ERA-40) products. This paper presents the analysis of the six products in depicting the mean, the seasonal cycle, and the interannual variability of the net heat flux into the ocean. Two time series of in situ flux measurements, one taken from a 1-yr Arabian Sea Experiment field program and the other from a 1-month Joint Air?Sea Monsoon Interaction Experiment (JASMINE) field program in the Bay of Bengal were used to evaluate the statistical properties of the flux products over the measurement periods. The consistency between the six products on seasonal and interannual time scales was investigated using a standard deviation analysis and a physically based correlation analysis. The study has three findings. First of all, large differences exist in the mean value of the six heat flux products. Part of the differences may be attributable to the bias in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models that underestimates the net heat flux into the Indian Ocean. Along the JASMINE ship tracks, the four NWP modeled mean fluxes all have a sign opposite to the observations, with NCEP1 being underestimated by 53 W m?2 (the least biased) and ECMWF-OP by 108 W m?2 (the most biased). At the Arabian Sea buoy site, the NWP mean fluxes also have an underestimation bias, with the smallest bias of 26 W m?2 (ERA-40) and the largest bias of 69 W m?2 (NCEP1). On the other hand, the OAFlux+ISCCP has the best comparison at both measurement sites. Second, the bias effect changes with the time scale. Despite the fact that the mean is biased significantly, there is no major bias in the seasonal cycle of all the products except for ECMWF-OP. The latter does not have a fixed mean due to the frequent updates of the model platform. Finally, among the four products (OAFlux+ISCCP, ERA-40, NCEP1, and NCEP2) that can be used for studying interannual variability, OAFlux+ISCCP and ERA-40 Qnet have good consistency as judged from both statistical and physical measures. NCEP1 shows broad agreement with the two products, with varying details. By comparison, NCEP2 is the least representative of the Qnet variabilities over the basin scale.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The present study used a new net surface heat flux (Qnet) product obtained from the Objective Analyzed Air?Sea Fluxes (OAFlux) project and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) to examine two specific issues?one is to which degree Qnet controls seasonal variations of sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Atlantic Ocean (20Â°S?20Â°N, east of 60Â°W), and the other is whether the physical relation can serve as a measure to evaluate the physical representation of a heat flux product. To better address the two issues, the study included the analysis of three additional heat flux products: the Southampton Oceanographic Centre (SOC) heat flux analysis based on ship reports, and the model fluxes from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction?National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP?NCAR) reanalysis and the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40). The study also uses the monthly subsurface temperature fields from the World Ocean Atlas to help analyze the seasonal changes of the mixed layer depth (hMLD). The study showed that the tropical Atlantic sector could be divided into two regimes based on the influence level of Qnet. SST variability poleward of 5Â°S and 10Â°N is dominated by the annual cycle of Qnet. In these regions the warming (cooling) of the sea surface is highly correlated with the increased (decreased) Qnet confined in a relatively shallow (deep) hMLD. The seasonal evolution of SST variability is well predicted by simply relating the local Qnet with a variable hMLD. On the other hand, the influence of Qnet diminishes in the deep Tropics within 5Â°S and 10Â°N and ocean dynamic processes play a dominant role. The dynamics-induced changes in SST are most evident along the two belts, one of which is located on the equator and the other off the equator at about 3Â°N in the west, which tilts to about 10Â°N near the northwestern African coast. The study also showed that if the degree of consistency between the correlation relationships of Qnet, hMLD, and SST variability serves as a measure of the quality of the Qnet product, then the Qnet from OAFlux + ISCCP and ERA-40 are most physically representative, followed by SOC. The NCEP?NCAR Qnet is least representative. It should be noted that the Qnet from OAFlux + ISCCP and ERA-40 have a quite different annual mean pattern. OAFlux + ISCCP agrees with SOC in that the tropical Atlantic sector gains heat from the atmosphere on the annual mean basis, where the ERA-40 and the NCEP?NCAR model reanalyses indicate that positive Qnet occurs only in the narrow equatorial band and in the eastern portion of the tropical basin. Nevertheless, seasonal variances of the Qnet from OAFlux + ISCCP and ERA-40 are very similar once the respective mean is removed, which explains why the two agree with each other in accounting for the seasonal variability of SST. In summary, the study suggests that an accurate estimation of surface heat flux is crucially important for understanding and predicting SST fluctuations in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It also suggests that future emphasis on improving the surface heat flux estimation should be placed more on reducing the mean bias.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A new daily latent and sensible flux product developed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) with 1Â° ? 1Â° resolution for the Atlantic Ocean (65Â°S?65Â°N) for the period from 1988 to 1999 was presented. The flux product was developed by using a variational objective analysis approach to obtain best estimates of the flux-related basic surface meteorological variables (e.g., wind speed, air humidity, air temperature, and sea surface temperature) through synthesizing satellite data and outputs of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The state-of-the-art bulk flux algorithm 2.6a, developed from the field experiments of the Coupled Ocean?Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE), was applied to compute the flux fields. The study focused on analyzing the mean field properties of the WHOI daily latent and sensible heat fluxes and their comparisons with the ship-based climatology from the Southampton Oceanography Centre (SOC) and NWP outputs. It is found that the WHOI yearly mean fluxes are consistent with the SOC climatology in both structure and amplitude, but the WHOI yearly mean basic variables are not always consistent with SOC; the better agreement in the fluxes is due to the effects of error compensation during variable combinations. Both ECMWF and NCEP?Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) Reanalysis-2 (NCEP2) model data have larger turbulent heat loss (?20 W m?2) than the WHOI product. Nevertheless, the WHOI fluxes agree well with the NCEP-2 Reanalysis fluxes in structure and the trend of year-to-year variations, but not with the ECMWF operational outputs; the latter have a few abrupt changes coinciding with the modifications in the model forecast?analysis system. The degree of impact of the model changes on the basic variables is not as dramatic, a factor that justifies the inclusion of the basic variables, not the fluxes, from the ECMWF operational model in the synthesis. The flux algorithms of the two NWP models give a larger latent and sensible heat loss. Recalculating the NWP fluxes using the COARE algorithm considerably reduces the strength but does not replicate the WHOI results. The present analysis could not quantify the degree of improvement in the mean aspect of the WHOI daily flux fields as accurate basinwide verification data are lacking. This study is the first to demonstrate that the synthesis approach is a useful tool for combining the NWP and satellite data sources and improving the mean representativeness of daily basic variable fields and, hence, the daily flux fields.

The present study evaluated the degree of improvement made by the WHOI analysis using in situ buoy/ship measurements as verification data. The measurements were taken from the following field experiments: the five-buoy Subduction Experiment in the eastern subtropical North Atlantic, three coastal field programs in the western Atlantic, two winter cruises by R/V Knorr from the Labrador Sea Deep Convection Experiment, and the Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA). The differences between the observed and the WHOI-analyzed fluxes and surface meteorological variables were quantified. Comparisons with the outputs from two numerical weather prediction (NWP) models were also conducted. The mean and daily variability of the latent and sensible heat fluxes from the WHOI analysis are an improvement over the NWP fluxes at all of the measurement sites. The improved flux representation is due to the use of not only a better flux algorithm but also the improved estimates for flux-related variables. The mean differences from the observations in latent heat flux and sensible heat flux, respectively, range from 2.9 (3% of the corresponding mean measurement value) and 1.0 W m?2 (13%) at the Subduction Experiment site, to 11.9 (13%) and 0.7 W m?2 (11%) across the PIRATA array, to 15.9 (20%) and 10.5 W m?2 (34%) at the coastal buoy sites, to 8.7 (7%) and 9.7 W m?2 (6%) along the Knorr cruise tracks. The study also suggests that further improvement in the accuracy of latent and sensible heat fluxes will depend on the availability of high-quality SST observations and improved representation/observations of air humidity in the tropical Atlantic.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Time series measurements from the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean array during the 1980s and 1990s are used to analyze the dynamics of the long-term mean, the seasonal cycle, and interannual variability in the upper 250 m of the equatorial Pacific. The analysis is based on a diagnosis of the zonal momentum equation using surface winds, ocean temperatures, and currents between 165Â°E and 110Â°W along the equator. In the mean, the balance is mainly between zonal wind stress and depth-integrated zonal pressure gradient, in good agreement with linear Sverdrup theory. For the seasonal cycle, the balance is mainly between wind stress, pressure gradient, and local acceleration, with differences between the stress and pressure gradient leading to accelerations and decelerations of the South Equatorial Current and Equatorial Undercurrent. On interannual timescales, local acceleration is much smaller than either zonal wind stress or zonal pressure gradient, indicating that to zeroth order, variations in the equatorial Pacific are in quasi-equilibrium with the wind forcing. Consistent with this quasi-equilibrium balance, Equatorial Undercurrent transports in the thermocline vary nearly in phase with the strength of the zonal pressure gradient and the easterly trade winds. Nonlinear effects are significant on all timescales, though of secondary importance in the depth-integrated zonal momentum balance.

  Abstract                 = {An oceanic general circulation model is used to investigate the annual cycle of the near-surface currents in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean; in particular, the causes of the springtime increase of eastward momentum that reverses the westward surface flow and intensifies the Equatorial Undercurrent are examined. A set of process experiments are carried out that isolates effects due to three forcing mechanisms: local zonal and meridional winds, and remote zonal winds. It is demonstrated that the springtime weakening of the local easterly trades is the primary cause of the eastward-momentum increase. In addition, due to meridional advection, the local southerly wind drives a westward current on the equator throughout the year; this flow is weakest in the spring, and therefore this process also contributes to the anomalous eastward flow. On the other hand, remote forcing tends to weaken the springtime momentum increase: Anomalous easterlies in the far-western and central Pacific during the winter excite upwelling-favorable Kelvin waves that generate anomalous westward flow in the eastern Pacific during the early spring.},

  Abstract                 = {Space-based scatterometer instruments provide crucial surface wind measurements with high resolution over global oceans. Midlatitude regions in the Southern Ocean are unique places to evaluate scatterometer winds at high-wind bands because these regions host the strongest wind fields at the ocean surface. The objective of this study is to evaluate high wind speeds observed by Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) wind measurements and produced by simulation models and compare them with weather station data in the Southern Ocean. The occurrence and intensity of high-wind events in scatterometer measurements are compared with that of reanalysis winds, and the spatial and seasonal variability of high-wind characteristics is examined. The results show that the speeds of scatterometer winds are similar to model simulations in the monthly mean field but consistently stronger than both European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research winds in high-wind bands. When scatterometer winds are compared with the weather station observations at Macquarie Island, the present study finds no systematic bias at high-wind bands across all months. However, both weather station and QuikSCAT winds are higher than the model simulations in high-wind bands most of the time. This suggests that model simulations may underestimate surface wind strength in high-wind bands. Such underestimation would lead to up to an 80% reduction in energy flux between the atmosphere and ocean. Even though high winds occur only sporadically and the reanalysis underestimation in high wind speed is not in itself of great magnitude, they have a significant impact on global climate.},

We revised an ocean surface spectrum using the CMOD-5 geophysical model function (GMF) for the European Remote Sensing (ERS) C-band scatterometer and the Ku-band GMF for the NASA SeaWinds scatterometer. The predictions of microwave brightness temperatures from this model agree well with satellite, aircraft and tower-based microwave radiometer data. This suggests that the impact of surface roughness on microwave brightness temperatures and radar scattering coefficients of sea surfaces can be consistently characterized by a roughness spectrum, providing physical basis for using combined active and passive remote sensing techniques for ocean surface wind and salinity remote sensing.},

This new concept has strong potential for improving the wind direction accuracy and extending the useful swath width by up to 30% for follow-on NASA spaceborne scatterometer mission to SeaWinds series. The key issue is whether there is a relationship between the polarization state of ocean backscatter and surface wind velocity at NASA scatterometer frequencies (13 GHz). An airborne Ku-band polarimetric scatterometer (POLSCAT) was developed for proof-of-concept measurements. A set of aircraft flights indicated repeatable wind direction signals in the POLSCAT observations of sea surfaces at 9-11 m/s wind speed. The correlation coefficients between co- and cross-polarized radar response of ocean surfaces have a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 0.4 and are shown to have an odd-symmetry with respect to the wind direction, unlike the normalized radar cross sections},

The error sources include the sea surface temperature, sea surface roughness, atmospheric gases, ionospheric Faraday rotation, and planetary and galatic emission sources. It is shown that the brightness temperature errors of a few Kelvin can be expected for most of these error sources. The key requirements for corrections are the knowledge accuracy of 0.5 deg;C for the sea surface temperature (SST), 10 deg;C for the surface air temperature, 0.2 deg; accuracy for the Faraday rotation, and 0.3 m/s for the surface wind speed. The authors suggest the use of data products from AMSR-type instruments for the corrections of SST and liquid cloud water, the numerical weather analysis for the surface air temperature, and on-board radar and polarimetric radiometer channel for surface roughness and Faraday rotation. The most significant sky radiation is from the Sun. A careful design of the antenna is necessary to minimize the leakage of solar radiation or reflection into the antenna side lobe. The narrowband radiation from galatic hydrogen clouds is also significant, but can be corrected with an accurate radio sky survey or minimized with a notched (band-rejection) alter centered at 1.420 GHz in the receiver},

  Abstract                 = {Satellite and airborne radar altimeter return signals often contain the specular component primarily in polar regions due to the backscatter from a relatively smooth and planar water or ice surface. It is demonstrated here that the specular backscatter from a planar surface should be estimated taking into account the spherical nature of the incident electromagnetic wave. This article introduces the radar equation derived using the physical optics approach and describes the backscatter as a function of the spatial distribution of the complex Fresnel reflection coefficient across a planar surface. The closed form of the radar equation was obtained for an infinite surface, an annulus and a disk with sizes greater than the radius of the first Fresnel zone.},

The measurement method is based on stereophotography and image brightness contrast processing. As found, spectra of decimeter waves are almost isotropic and weakly dependent on the wind speed. Both directional anisotropy and wind sensitivity rapidly increase at wavenumbers larger than 100 rad/m. These aspects are consistent with other previously reported optical and radar data. Following these new in situ measurements, a revision of a semi-empirical model of short wind wave spectrum is suggested. This revised model can readily be implemented in other studies (radar scattering, air-sea interaction issues) where detailed knowledge of short wind wave spectra is crucial.},

  Abstract                 = {Laboratory results showing that the air-water gas transfer velocity k is correlated with mean square wave slope have been cited as evidence that a wave-related mechanism regulates k at low to moderate wind speeds [JÃ¤hne et al., 1987; Bock et al., 1999]. Csanady [1990] has modeled the effect of microscale wave breaking on air-water gas transfer with the result that k is proportional to the fractional surface area covered by surface renewal generated during the breaking process. In this report we investigate the role of microscale wave breaking in gas transfer by determining the correlation between k and AB, the fractional area coverage of microscale breaking waves. Simultaneous, colocated infrared (IR) and wave slope imagery is used to verify that AB detected using IR techniques corresponds to the fraction of surface area covered by surface renewal in the wakes of microscale breaking waves. Using measurements of k and AB made at the University of Washington wind-wave tank at wind speeds from 4.6 to 10.7 m sâ1, we show that k is linearly correlated with AB, regardless of the presence of surfactants. This result is consistent with Csanady's [1990] model and implies that microscale wave breaking is likely a fundamental physical mechanism contributing to gas transfer.},

  abstract = {The role of microscale wave breaking in controlling the air-water transfer of heat and gas is investigated in a laboratory wind-wave tank. The local heat transfer velocity, kH, is measured using an active infrared technique and the tank-averaged gas transfer velocity, kG, is measured using conservative mass balances. Simultaneous, colocated infrared and wave slope imagery show that wave-related areas of thermal boundary layer disruption and renewal are the turbulent wakes of microscale breaking waves, or microbreakers. The fractional area coverage of microbreakers, AB, is found to be 0.1-0.4 in the wind speed range 4.2-9.3 m sâ1 for cleaned and surfactant-influenced surfaces, and kH and kG are correlated with AB. The correlation of kH with AB is independent of fetch and the presence of surfactants, while that for kG with AB depends on surfactants. Additionally, AB is correlated with the mean square wave slope,\80\89, which has shown promise as a correlate for kG in previous studies. The ratio of kH measured inside and outside the microbreaker wakes is 3.4, demonstrating that at these wind speeds, up to 75% of the transfer is the direct result of microbreaking. These results provide quantitative evidence that microbreaking is the dominant mechanism contributing to air-water heat and gas transfer at low to moderate wind speeds.},

  abstract = {We present a passive optical remote sensing technique for recovering shape information about a water surface, in the form of a two-dimensional slope map. The method, known as polarimetric slope sensing (PSS), uses the relationship between surface orientation and the change in polarization of reflected light to infer the instantaneous two-dimensional slope across the field-of-view of an imaging polarimeter. For unpolarized skylight, the polarization orientation and degree of linear polarization of the reflected skylight provide sufficient information to determine the local surface slope vectors. A controlled laboratory experiment was carried out in a wave tank with mechanically generated gravity waves. A second study was performed from a pier on the Hudson River, near Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. We demonstrated that the two-dimensional slope field of short gravity waves could be recovered accurately without interfering with the fluid dynamics of the air or water, and water surface features appear remarkably realistic. The combined field and laboratory results demonstrate that the polarimetric camera gives a robust characterization of the fine-scale surface wave features that are intrinsic to wind-driven air-sea interaction processes.},

  abstract  = {Refining radiative-transfer modeling capabilities for light transmission through the sea surface requires a more detailed prescription of the sea surface roughness beyond the probability density function of the sea surface slope field. To meet this need, exciting new measurement methodologies now provide the opportunity to enhance present knowledge of sea surface roughness, especially at the microscale. In this context, two intensive field experiments using R/PFloating Instrument Platformwere staged within the Office of Naval Research's Radiance in a Dynamic Ocean (RaDyO) field program in the Santa Barbara Channel and in the central Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii. As part of this program, our team gathered and analyzed a comprehensive suite of sea surface roughness measurements designed to provide optimal coverage of fundamental optical distortion processes associated with the air-sea interface. This contribution describes the ensemble of instrumentation deployed. It provides a detailed documentation of the ambient environmental conditions that prevailed during the RaDyO field experiments. It also highlights exciting new sea surface roughness measurement capabilities that underpin a number of the scientific advances resulting from the RaDyO program. For instance, a new polarimetric imaging camera highlights the complex interplay of wind and surface currents in shaping the roughness of the sea surface that suggests the traditional Cox-Munk framework is not sufficient. In addition, the breaking crest length spectral density derived from visible and infrared imagery is shown to be modulated by the development of the wavefield (wave age) and alignment of wind and surface currents at the intermediate (dominant) scale of wave breaking.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the launch of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), different sea surface salinity (SSS) level 3 (L3) research products have been developed by several institutions, including the Barcelona Expert Centre (BEC) in Spain and the Centre Aval de Traitement des DonnÃ©es SMOS (CATDS) in France. This letter assesses the performances of BEC âOcean Reprocessing Campaign 2012001â L3 data and CATDS Version 2 (V02) L3 data by comparing both of them with Argo upper salinity measurements (within 5-m depth). Twenty-month data from May 2010 to December 2011 are selected for the study. Through computing differences and root-mean-square errors of the differences between BEC and Argo data as well as between CATDS V02 and Argo data at each $1^{circ} times 1^{circ}$ grid point, it is observed that CATDS V02 data are of better quality along coasts and in high latitudes than BEC data owing to different-SSS-bias mitigation such as applying a correction with respect to the climatology in $5^{circ} times 5^{circ}$ boxes and using the same ocean target transformation for the whole processing. In open ocean, however, both SMOS data sets perform very well. Several regions are picked out to conduct the time series comparisons, and the results are similar.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we compare the ionogram-derived total electron content (ITEC) obtained at the low latitude station Hainan (geographical coordinates 19.4\'eN, 109.0\'eE; Dip = 22.8\'e), China with that derived from GPS signals produced by the International GPS Services for Geodynamics (TECigs) and the TEC data obtained by the altimeter on TOPEX satellite when it passed over nearby Hainan. We also compare them with the results produced by the current International Reference Ionosphere model (IRI2001) TECiri. Data used for the present comparison study are both the daily hourly and monthly median values for the 12 months of the descending solar activity year 2003. Our study showed that (1) in general ITEC is in agreement with TOPEX-TEC, although there are exceptions; (2) the total electron contents produced by all techniques (TECigs, ITEC and TECiri) can reproduce quiet well the remarkable semi-annual variation behavior of the total electron content; (3) the variation trends of ITEC and TECigs are generally in good agreement, however during nighttime to pre-sunrise hours ITEC is systematically lower than TECigs, whereas during daytime hours around local noontime ITEC is usually larger than TECigs. The absolute difference between ITEC and the TECigs ([up triangle, open]TEC1 = ITEC-TECigs) of the monthly median data is usually under the limit of 10-15 TECu (1 TECu = 1016 el/m2) during the diurnal variation, except for the time period 09-16UT(~17-24LT) in September and October when the value of [up triangle, open]TEC1 is larger than 15 TECu, fluctuating between about 15-25 TECu; (4) during nighttime hours TECiri is generally larger than TECigs, whereas during daytime hours TECiri is generally smaller than TECigs except for the months June and July when TECiri is slightly larger than TECigs; (5) the difference between ITEC and TECigs ([Delta]TEC1) and that between TECiri and TECigs ([Delta]TEC2) are almost reverse in their positive/negative signs at a given local time, however, the magnitudes of the maximum absolute values of [up triangle, open]TEC1 and [up triangle, open]TEC2 are comparable.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new analytical algorithm for the estimation of wind speeds from altimeter data using the mean square slope of the ocean surface, which is obtained by integration of a widely accepted wind-wave spectrum including the gravity-capillary wave range. It indicates that the normalized radar cross section depends not only on the wind speed but also on the wave age. The wave state effect on the altimeter radar return becomes remarkable with increasing wind speed and cannot be neglected at high wind speeds. A relationship between wave age and nondimensional wave height based on buoy observational data is applied to compute the wave age using the significant wave height of ocean waves, which could be simultaneously obtained from altimeter data. Comparison with actual data shows that this new algorithm produces more reliable wind speeds than do empirical algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Using Phillips equilibrium range theory and observational data, we show first that the total rates of wave energy dissipation estimated by the Hasselmann and Phillips dissipation models are substantially consistent with each other, though their original forms are different. Both are proportional to the cube of air friction velocity, u * 3, with a weak dependence on wave age. As a direct manifestation of the wave energy dissipation processes, we reanalyze previous observational data of whitecap coverage and find that it has greater correlation with the wind speed or friction velocity than the wave period or wave age. However, the data scatter decreases remarkably when the breaking-wave parameter R B = u * 2/vw p is used, where v is the kinematic viscosity of air, and w p , the wind-wave spectral peak frequency. Physical interpretation of R B with some related issues, and a discussion of the probability models of whitecap coverage in terms of a threshold mechanism, are also presented. We conclude that R B is a good parameter to effectively express the overall wave breaking behavior for the case of wind-waves in local equilibrium with the wind. Since R B can be expressed as the product of u * 3 and the wave age, this result demonstrates a stronger dependence of whitecap coverage on wave age than expected by the previous description by power-laws of u * and by the two theoretical models. Our conclusion suggests that current dissipation models should also be modified to represent full properties of wind-wave breaking.},

  Abstract                 = {The computerized ionospheric tomography (CIT) is an under-determined, ill-posed inverse problem. The limited-angle geometry and sparse receivers lead incomplete information in measurements, which affect the precision of the CIT imaging, especially in the vertical dimension. This paper puts forward a new method by combining vertical and oblique sounding data with the total electron content (TEC) retrieved from an assumed tri-band beacon of a planned Chinese satellite for seismological studies transmitting VHF, UHF and L-band frequencies. A ground-based high-resolution ionospheric observation network (GHRION) has been built in northern China in April, 2009. Based on this ground network and the planned satellite, high-resolution ionospheric structures will be reconstructed in real time, for helping monitoring the ionospheric precursors of earthquakes over several large seismic belts in northern China. The initial of the iterative is specified by real sounding data, so it slightly deviates from the real electron density distribution and the CIT result is in high precision. The numerical simulations show that electron density images reconstructed from TEC using three-frequency technique are significantly improved after combining real observation data of the ground-based vertical and oblique ionograms. The results in this paper will help to ensure that the measurements to be made by this solid network will yield their potential.},

  abstract = {Abstract Global soil moisture records are essential for studying the role of hydrologic processes within the larger earth system. Various studies have shown the benefit of assimilating satellite-based soil moisture data into water balance models or merging multisource soil moisture retrievals into a unified data set. However, this requires an appropriate parameterization of the error structures of the underlying data sets. While triple collocation (TC) analysis has been widely recognized as a powerful tool for estimating random error variances of coarse-resolution soil moisture data sets, the estimation of error cross covariances remains an unresolved challenge. Here we propose a method - referred to as extended collocation (EC) analysis-for estimating error cross-correlations by generalizing the TC method to an arbitrary number of data sets and relaxing the therein made assumption of zero error cross-correlation for certain data set combinations. A synthetic experiment shows that EC analysis is able to reliably recover true error cross-correlation levels. Applied to real soil moisture retrievals from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) C-band and X-band observations together with advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) retrievals, modeled data from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)-Noah and in situ measurements drawn from the International Soil Moisture Network, EC yields reasonable and strong nonzero error cross-correlations between the two AMSR-E products. Against expectation, nonzero error cross-correlations are also found between ASCAT and AMSR-E. We conclude that the proposed EC method represents an important step toward a fully parameterized error covariance matrix for coarse-resolution soil moisture data sets, which is vital for any rigorous data assimilation framework or data merging scheme.},

  abstract = {Abstract The changing Arctic freshwater content and distribution have significant implications for ocean circulation, climate, and water and biogeochemical cycles. The paucity of in-situ salinity measurements in the Arctic Ocean has limited our ability to study Arctic-Ocean freshwater variability. Although satellite-derived sea surface height (SSH) and ocean bottom pressure (OBP) have been used together to infer depth-integrated freshwater content changes, these measurements are limited in sampling and resolution. Motivated by the recent development of sea surface salinity (SSS) remote sensing, we explore the use of SSS as a proxy for Arctic freshwater changes. As a first step, here we conduct a proof-of-concept study by analyzing the output of an ocean-ice state estimation product. We find that SSS variations are coherent with those of SSH-minus-OBP across the Arctic basin (with R ~ -0.8) except for in the center of the Beaufort Gyre and the region affected by the subpolar North Atlantic inflow. On Arctic shelves, the linear regression coefficient between SSS and SSH-minus-OBP is -0.3 pss/cm or larger in magnitude. The results suggest that SSS is a good proxy for Arctic freshwater changes, and satellite SSH-minus-OBP can be used to evaluate satellite SSS quality.},

  abstract = {Abstract The ocean plays a dominant role in the global water cycle. It is the center of action for global evaporation and precipitation and supplies the moisture that falls as continental precipitation. It also acts to some extent as nature's rain gauge, as it tells us about the long-term changes in the global water cycle through monitoring of the changes in ocean surface salinity. As climate warms, the global water cycle is expected to intensify as a result of the strong nonlinear dependence of water vapor pressure (moisture-holding capacity) on temperature. Such change is of great concern, as it has profound socioeconomic impacts throughout the globe. Despite the evidence of an intensified global water cycle, two important questions remain: What is the pattern of the warming-induced intensification of the water cycle? and What is the rate of intensification? Our article provides a synthesis review of recent progress in diagnosing and understanding the changes in both the global water cycle and ocean salinity in recent decades. Targeted numerical ocean model experiments are also reviewed to provide insights into the response of salinity to the changes in evaporation-minus-precipitation flux, meltwater runoff, and ocean warming.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the quality and accuracy of state-of-the-art time-varying salinity information is being established by comparing existing products against each other as well as against existing ocean reanalyzes and satellite retrieval. The focus the paper is on large-scale salinity structures and their temporal variations from the sea surface down to 700\A0m depth. Uncertainties are quantified through the spread between all existing estimates on various time scales including long-term trends. Results suggest that uncertainties of time mean climatological salinity estimates are as large as 0.3 within the first 50\A0m of high vertical salinity gradients and even larger in some boundary regions. Over the open (deep) ocean, a near-surface spread of 0.1 can be observed; below 300\A0m depth it stays below 0.03 over most part of the world ocean. Measuring salinity in near-costal and highly dynamic regions remains problematic and calls for a better integration of existing in situ and satellite capabilities there. There remain challenges in estimating the amplitude of the salinity seasonal cycle from the existing in situ database. This holds especially within the tropics, where the disagreement between the seasonal salinity amplitude estimated from individual situ data sets is typically around 30%, locally even up to 50%. Regarding interannual and longer-term salinity changes, inferred trend patterns agree well with the standard deviation of the decadal climatologies, suggesting that it remains difficult to obtain statistically significant estimates of long-term trends from the existing short data base over the world ocean. Overall, our results call for further improvements of ocean reanalysis products and their expanded use in studies of ocean variability and changes in the future.},

However, the complex sequence of processes that transform an event from notable to extreme can be challenging to identify and hence, limit forecast abilities. Here, we show an extreme heat content event (i.e., a marine heatwave) in coastal waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico resulted from compounding effects of a tropical storm followed by an atmospheric heatwave. This newly identified process of generating extreme ocean temperatures occurred prior to landfall of Hurricane Michael during October of 2018 and, as critical contributor to storm intensity, likely contributed to the subsequent extreme hurricane. This pattern of compounding processes will also exacerbate other environmental problems in temperature-sensitive ecosystems (e.g., coral bleaching, hypoxia) and is expected to have expanding impacts under global warming predictions.},

This study presents the first systematic analysis of 6 commonly used sea surface salinity (SSS) products from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aquarius and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites and the European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, in terms of their consistency among one another and with in-situ data. Overall, the satellite SSS products provide a similar characterization of the time mean SSS large-scale patterns and are relatively consistent in depicting the regions with strong SSS temporal variability. When averaged over the Arctic Ocean, the SSS show an excellent consistency in describing the seasonal and interannual variations. Comparison of satellite SSS with in-situ salinity measurements along ship transects suggest that satellite SSS captures salinity gradients away from regions with significant sea-ice concentration. The root-mean square differences (RMSD) of satellite SSS with respect to in-situ measurements improves with increasing temperature, reflecting the limitation of L-band radiometric sensitivity to SSS in cold water. However, the satellite SSS biases with respect to the in-situ measurements do not show a consistent dependence on temperature. The results have significant implications for the calibration and validation of satellite SSS as well as for the modeling community and the design of future satellite missions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Here we present an observation-based study of the coupled land-ocean regions of influence for the transformation of precipitation over land into coastal river plume structure in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). First, we locate the regions on land for which precipitation and runoff generation have the strongest relationship with local river discharge. Then we map, on average, the apparent unique contribution of individual river discharge forcing to specific features of river plume structure across the GoM. To this end, we employ a spatial-temporal lagged correlation analysis that relates satellite-based precipitation, soil moisture, and sea surface salinity observations to in situ river discharge for the three primary freshwater input sources for the GoM. On land, we find a likely source region for the northeastern GoM in the southeastern Mississippi basin at 16-day lead time, a likely source region for the northeastern GoM in the Mobile Bay basin at 3-day lead time and a likely source region for the Central GoM from the Texas basin region at 4-day lead time. In the ocean, we find statistically significant regions of distinct contribution for each of the three sources of freshwater on plume structure at lag times from weeks to several months. Though a statistical approach is limited in its interpretability, this result advances progress toward a predictive framework for mapping of the impacts of hydrological flood events from land into the ocean using observations alone.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Bay of Bengal receives large amounts of freshwater from the Ganga-Brahmaputra (GB) river during the summer monsoon. The resulting upper-ocean freshening influences seasonal rainfall, cyclones, and biological productivity. Sparse in situ observations and previous modeling studies suggest that the East India Coastal Current (EICC) transports these freshwaters southward after the monsoon as an approximately 200 km wide, 2,000 km long "river in the sea" along the East Indian coast. Sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite provides unprecedented views of this peculiar feature from intraseasonal to interannual timescales. SMAP SSS has a 0.83 correlation and 0.49 rms-difference to 0-5 m in situ measurements. SMAP and in stu data both indicate a SSS standard deviation of ~0.7 to 1 away from the coast, that rises to 2 pss within 100 km of the coast, providing a very favorable signal-to-noise ratio in coastal areas. SMAP also captures the strong northern BoB, postmonsoon cross-shore SSS contrasts (?10 pss) measured along ship transects. SMAP data are also consistent with previous modeling results that suggested a modulation of the EICC/GB plume southward extent by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Remote forcing associated with the negative Indian Ocean Dipole in the fall of 2016 indeed caused a stronger EICC and "river in the sea" that extended by approximately 800 km further south than that in 2015 (positive IOD year). The combination of SMAP and altimeter data shows eddies stirring the freshwater plume away from the coast.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study investigates sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the tropical Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles, a region where freshwater advection from the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers, may potentially impact air-sea interaction. Observations are used to document later-summer variability and evaluate offshore riverine transport from 2010 to 2014. During this period, the largest difference in plume-affected areas, defined as the extent covered by SSS lower than 35.5 pss, is found between 2011 and 2014. Plume waters covered 92\% of the study region in 2011 and 60\% in 2014, with the average SSS in the study region being 2 pss lower in 2011. Lagrangian particle tracking based on satellite-derived ocean currents is used to diagnose the impact of the river plumes on SSS and SST from 2010 to 2014. Northward freshwater flux in summer 2014 was significantly weaker than fluxes in 2010?2013. This difference is not due to interannual discharge variability, but to significant changes in eddy-driven transport and cross-shore winds. In particular, the stronger cross-shore wind in May 2014 restricted offshore freshwater flow and lead to a smaller plume-affected area. Persistent SST gradients are often found near the plume edge, which may have implications for ocean-atmosphere coupling associated with atmospheric convection. SST in the study region was 1\B0C higher in 2010 compared to other years, and is related to basin-scale ocean-atmosphere processes. Interannual variation in Amazon advective pathways and the associated SSS changes are also influenced by changes in the ITCZ position between 2011 and 2014.},

We enter now in a new era of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) observing system from Space with the recent launches of the ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the NASA Aquarius/Sac-D missions. With these new sensors, we are now in an excellent position to revisit SSS and ocean color investigations in the tropical northwest Atlantic using multiyear remote sensing time series and concurrent in situ observations. The Amazon is the world's largest river in terms of discharge. In its plume, SSS and upper water column optical properties such as the absorption coefficient of colored detrital matter (acdm) are strongly negatively correlated (0.7). Local quasi-linear relationships between SSS and acdm are derived for these plume waters over the period of 2010?2013 using new spaceborne SSS and ocean color measurements. Results allow unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of this coupling. These relationships are then used to estimate SSS in the Amazon plume based on ocean color satellite data. This new product is validated against SMOS and in situ data and compared with previously developed SSS retrieval models. We demonstrate the potential to estimate tropical Atlantic SSS for the extended period from 1998 to 2010, prior to spaceborne SSS data collection.},

  abstract  = {Various estimates of freshwater discharge to the Arctic Ocean with different methods and for different drainage areas have shown a good consistency in long-term mean runoff ranging from 200 mm/year to 226 mm/year. Most of the estimates are derived from available discharge measurements at the downstream gauging stations. According to the most recent assessment of the total discharge to the Arctic Ocean is approximately 4300 km3 year?1 and continental contributions to the river input into the Arctic Ocean for Asia, North America, and Europe are 55{\%}, 28{\%}, and 17{\%}, respectively. The river flux to the Arctic Ocean has significantly changed with an increase of 210 km3 over 1936--2015 across Eurasia, and 36 km3 over 1964--2015 for northern Canada. These changes were especially pronounced during the last 30-years, associated with most intense warming of air temperature over the northern hemisphere and significant declines in sea ice extent over the Arctic Ocean. The significant increase in annual river flow is mainly due to increases in winter (60{\%}) and spring (33{\%}) discharge. Winter flows have a very consistent and significant increase throughout the Eurasian pan-Arctic. All six largest Eurasian Arctic rivers show a significant increase in winter river flows over the long-term period 1936--2015. Similar but less significant trends in winter and spring discharge were found for Canadian northern rivers. Seasonal discharge has been altered as the result of human activity, particularly reservoir regulation. Eliminating reservoir effect in the largest Arctic rivers of Yenisei, Lena, and Ob, using the hydrograph transformation model, show significant increase in annual discharge, i.e., increase in spring by 49{\%}, winter by 31{\%}, and summer-fall by 20{\%}. These results are different from those obtained from the observational discharge data. Thus, for hydroclimatic analysis to understand possible changes in river flux to the Arctic Ocean, it is necessary to take into account human impact on the discharge regime and change. Sea surface salinity (SSS) links various components of the Arctic freshwater system, including river discharge. Analysis of remote sensed SSS data has shown that SSS distribution pattern in the Arctic Ocean during warm period is partly defined by river flux. There is a great potential of using remote sensing data for a better understanding of variability in the Arctic freshwater system.},

  abstract = {Precise localization of semantic segmentation is attracting increasing attention, and salient performances are dominated by deep learning-based methods, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). However, the outputs from the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object boundaries due to their invariance properties, which makes precise boundary recovery of semantic segmentation an academically challenging question. Both 2D and 3D objects suffer from the same problem. Considering this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of precise boundary recovery for semantic segmentation, focusing mainly on 2D images and 3D point clouds. Firstly, we formulate the problem of potential boundary recovery for semantic segmentation based on DCNNs, elaborate on the terminology as well as background concepts in this field. Then, we categorize boundary recovery methods into four strategies according to their techniques and network architectures to discuss how they obtain accurate boundaries of semantic segmentation. Next, publicly available datasets on which they have been assessed are argued. To compare these datasets, we design diagrams based on five indicators to help researchers judge which are the ones that best suit their tasks. Moreover, we further compare and analyze the performance of all the reviewed methods through experimental results. Finally, current challenges and prospective research issues are discussed extensively.},

  year     = {2021},
  number   = {11},
  volume   = {126},
  abstract = {Abstract Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) is an increasingly-used Essential Ocean and Climate Variable. The SMOS, Aquarius, and SMAP satellite missions all provide SSS measurements, with very different instrumental features leading to specific measurement characteristics. The Climate Change Initiative Salinity project (CCI+SSS) aims to produce a SSS Climate Data Record (CDR) that addresses well-established user needs based on those satellite measurements. To generate a homogeneous CDR, instrumental differences are carefully adjusted based on in-depth analysis of the measurements themselves, together with some limited use of independent reference data. An optimal interpolation in the time domain without temporal relaxation to reference data or spatial smoothing is applied. This allows preserving the original datasets variability. SSS CCI fields are well-suited for monitoring weekly to interannual signals, at spatial scales ranging from 50 km to the basin scale. They display large year-to-year seasonal variations over the 2010-2019 decade, sometimes by more than +/-0.4 over large regions. The robust standard deviation of the monthly CCI SSS minus in situ Argo salinities is 0.15 globally, while it is at least 0.20 with individual satellite SSS fields. r2 is 0.97, similar or better than with original datasets. The correlation with independent ship thermosalinographs SSS further highlights the CCI dataset excellent performance, especially near land areas. During the SMOS-Aquarius period, when the representativity uncertainties are the largest, r2 is 0.84 with CCI while it is 0.48 with the Aquarius original dataset. SSS CCI data are freely available and will be updated and extended as more satellite data become available.},

  year     = {2020},
  abstract = {<p>10 years of L-Band remote sensing Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) measurements have proven the capability of satellite SSS to resolve large scale to mesoscale SSS features in tropical to subtropical ocean. In mid to high latitude, L-Band measurements still suffer from large scale and time varying biases. Here, a simple method is proposed to mitigate the large scale and time varying biases. First, in order to estimate these biases, an Optimal Interpolation (OI) using a large correlation scale is used to map SMOS and SMAP L3 products and is compared to equivalent mapping of in situ observations. Then, a second mapping is performed on corrected SSS at scale of SMOS/SMAP resolution (~45 km). This procedure allows to correct and merge both products, and to increase signal to noise ratio of the absolute SSS estimates. Using thermodynamic equation of state (TEOS-10), the resulting L4 SSS product is combined with microwave satellite SST products to produce sea surface density and spiciness, useful to fully characterize the surface ocean water masses. The new L4 SSS products is validated against independent in situ measurements from low to high latitudes. The L4 products exhibits a significant improvement in mid-and high latitude in comparison to the existing SMOS and SMAP L3 products. However, in the Arctic Ocean, L-Band SSS retrieval issues such as sea ice contamination and low sensitivity in cold water are still challenging to improve L-Band SSS data.</p>},

  abstract = {Abstract The Amazon River low-salinity plume takes part in important ocean and atmosphere processes that influence climate. In the last three decades, the intensification of the hydrological cycle has increased the interannual variability of total freshwater discharged into the ocean. However, the feedback mechanisms of the Amazon River plume acting on this intensification are not fully understood. Correlation maps and multiple regression analysis applied to 16 years of satellite data and river flow measurements indicate that a positive precipitation trend of 15 mm/year in the western Amazon basin follows the long-term warming of the tropical Atlantic. This increased the total amount of freshwater discharged into the ocean and reduced the Amazon River plume salinity by 3.5\% per year in the main plume water export pathway. Based on these results we propose a process-oriented model of the feedback process that explains the intensification of the Amazon hydrological cycle.},

  abstract       = {The Vend&eacute;e Globe is the world&rsquo;s most famous solo, non-stop, unassisted sailing race. The Institute of Marine Sciences and the Barcelona Ocean Sailing Foundation installed a MicroCAT on the One Ocean One Planet boat. The skipper, D&iacute;dac Costa, completed the round trip in 97 days, from 8 November 2020 to 13 February 2021, providing one measurement of temperature and conductivity every 30 s during navigation. More than half of the ship&rsquo;s route was in the sub-Antarctic zone, between the tropical and polar fronts, and it passed through areas of oceanographic interest such as Southern Patagonia (affected by glacier melting), the Brazil&ndash;Malvinas confluence, the Southern Pacific Ocean, and the entire Southern Indian Ocean. This sailing race gave a rare opportunity to measure in-situ sea surface salinity in a region where satellite salinity measurements are not reliable. Due to the decreased sensitivity of brightness temperature to salinity in cold seas, retrieving sea surface salinity at high latitudes remains a major challenge. This paper describes how the data are processed and uses the data to validate satellite salinity products in the sub-Antarctic zone. The sailing race measurements represent surface information (60 cm depth) not available from drifters or Argo floats. Acquiring measurements using round-the-world sailing races would allow us to analyse the evolution of ocean salinity and the impact of changes in the ice extent around Antarctica.},

  pages    = {25},
  abstract = {Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) can change as a result of surface freshwater forcing (FWF), or internal ocean processes such as upwelling or advection. At the seasonal scale, SSS should follow FWF by ¼ cycle, or 3 months, if FWF is the primary process controlling it at the seasonal scale. In this paper we compare the phase relationship between SSS and FWF (i.e. evaporation minus precipitation over mixed layer depth) over the global (non-Arctic) ocean using in situ SSS and satellite evaporation and precipitation. We find that instead of the expected 3 month delay between SSS and FWF, the delay is mostly closer to 1-2 months, with SSS peaking too soon relative to FWF. We then compute monthly vertical entrainment and horizontal advection terms of the upper ocean salinity balance equation and add their contributions to the phase of the FWF. The addition of these processes to the seasonal upper ocean salinity balance brings the phase difference between SSS and the forcing processes closer to the expected value. We do a similar computation with the amplitude of the seasonal SSS and the forcing terms, with less definitive results. The results of this study highlight the important role that ocean processes play in the global freshwater cycle at the seasonal scale.},
