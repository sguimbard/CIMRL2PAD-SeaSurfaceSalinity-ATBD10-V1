# Abstract

This document provides the theoretical basis for the CIMR salinity retrieval algorithm. The inputs to the algorithm are the CIMR L-band Top Of the Atmosphere (TOA) measurements along with a number of auxiliary products and pre-computed tables of forward model emission and geophysical data. The output is sea-surface salinity and intermediate variables required for the salinity calculation. This is the pre-launch version of the ATBD. Changes made postlaunch will be included as addenda and updated periodically. In particular, the sea water dielectric constant model at L-band and the roughness correction is based on pre-launch information from SMOS, Aquarius, and SMAP missions and changes are likely as soon as data from the radiometer become available.
