  abstract = {Equilibrium spectral behavior for ocean gravity wind waves has been investigated actively over the past three decades, yet fundamental problems remain in reconciling theory with observations. Predicted equilibrium spectral forms from physical models proposed recently by Kitaigorodskii and by Phillips are examined in the light of wavenumber and frequency spectra reported by several investigators. While frequency domain observations appear to support the model predictions, observed wavenumber spectra are found to differ both in the spectral dependence on wavenumber and on the wind speed. Based on observed wavenumber and frequency spectra for fetch-limited condition a model is proposed for the form of the directional wavenumber spectrum slice in the dominant wave direction. Reduced wavenumber and frequency spectra are calculated from this model, assuming an empirical spectral directional spreading function and the linear gravity wave dispersion relation. These calculations reveal the underlying influences which shape these reduced spectra. In the energy containing subrange, just above the spectral peak, the dominant influence shaping these spectra is the variation of the directional spreading function with distance from the spectral peak. For frequency spectra, at higher frequencies, the model calculations predict that the range of observed frequency spectral dependences is due primarily to the Doppler shifting from advection of the shorter waves by the orbital motion of the dominant waves, with possible additional influences of wind drift and ambient currents. Combining these results, composite calculated frequency spectra and one-dimensional wavenumber spectra show close correspondence with measured field spectra. In addition to clarifying the key processes that shape different regimes in the frequency spectrum, a refinement of the bounds of the gravity equilibrium subrange is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {We present estimates of whitecap coverage on a global scale from satellite-measured brightness temperature of the ocean surface. This is a first step in a larger framework aiming at more realistic modeling of the high variability of whitecap coverage as a function of wind speed and a suite of additional environmental and meteorological factors. The involvement of oceanic whitecaps in various physical and chemical processes important for climate studies such as production of sea-salt aerosols, enhancement of air-sea gas exchange, and influence on retrievals of ocean surface wind and ocean color motivates this effort. A critical review of the physical variables causing the high variability of whitecap coverage and existing approaches modeling this variability establishes the need for a database of whitecap coverage and concomitant measurements of additional factors. The necessity to build such an extensive database justifies the quest for a method estimating whitecap coverage from satellite data. We describe the physical concept, a possible implementation, error analysis, results, and evaluation of a method for estimating whitecap coverage from routine satellite measurements. The advantages of the concept and the drawbacks and necessary improvements of the implementation are discussed.},

abstract = {Following the approach of Tang [1974], the microwave brightness of the sea surface is recalculated with recent parameterizations in terms of wind velocity for the slope distribution and whitecap coverage of the sea surface and the contribution of sea spray. The difference between this revised calculation with no free parameters and the earlier one becomes more significant as the wind velocity increases; it reaches 10 K or more at a wind velocity of 20 m s−1. Present predictions compare favorably with experimental results, suggesting that this model does include the essential physical mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {We have examined historical distributions of sea surface salinity (SSS) observations in a data set consisting of a combination of the World Ocean Database 1998 (WOD98) and a thermosalinograph and bucket salinity database collected from volunteer observing ships. It is well known that SSS in much of the world's ocean is measured infrequently or not at all. We find that 27% of one-degree squares in the world ocean (open and coastal, excluding the Arctic Ocean) had no observations of SSS in the historical database, and 70% had 10 or fewer. Systematic sampling of SSS (more than 10,000 observations per year globally) did not start until after 1960. Most SSS observations in the WOD98 are concentrated in the North Sea and coast of northern Europe, the east and west coasts of North America, and around Japan. About 28% of SSS measurements are in coastal waters. We plotted frequency histograms of SSS for some selected well-sampled one-degree squares in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific. We found most frequency histograms to be non-Gaussian. The main departure from normal distribution is due to anomalous low-salinity measurements creating a negative skewness. This conclusion is verified as a global phenomenon by examining statistics of mean-median SSS difference within one-degree squares. This quantity is found to be predominantly negative over the global ocean. These anomalous low-salinity values may be due to rainfall events, but there are other plausible physical mechanisms, like frontal movement and eddy activity. There were also areas where the distributions were bimodal due to the presence of meandering fronts with little cross-frontal mixing. Examples are shown where the non-Gaussian nature of the distributions in the areas examined is both a short-term and a long-term phenomenon. That is, the distributions are skewed on a nearly instantaneous (âˆ¼1 month) basis and averaged over long time periods (1 + years). This has important implications for climatologies because the differences between mean and modal SSS, for the analyzed one-degree squares, is of order 0.1. Furthermore, the implication for validation studies for remote sensing missions is that the studies must make enough measurements of SSS to determine the extent to which the probability density is not Gaussian.},

abstract = {Seasonal estimates of oceanic whitecap coverage are presented on global contour maps. The instantaneous fraction of the sea surface covered by whitecaps as a function of wind speed has been described previously using a power law fitting technique [Monahan and Muircheartaigh, 1980]. This relationship, coupled with a Gaussian wind speed frequency distribution, allows us to calculate the oceanic whitecap coverage accounting for the variance about mean wind speeds. We use monthly mean wind speed and variance information in 5° latitude × 5° longitude areas over the world ocean to estimate the global oceanic whitecap coverage distribution. The whitecap coverage in the northern hemisphere oceans displays a substantial seasonal dependence. The boreal summer average whitecap coverage in the high-latitude North Atlantic is about 0.5\% and increases by a factor of roughly 6 to over 3.0\% for a boreal winter average. The whitecap coverage in the high-latitude southern hemisphere oceans exhibits only a factor of 3 difference for the same seasons, from about 1\% in the austral summer to over 3\% for the austral winter. There are several high-latitude areas with greater than 3\% average whitecap coverage over several months of the year. The monsoonal winds in the Indian Ocean result in over 3\% mean whitecap coverage for the June-July-August period.},

abstract = {Review of several recent ocean surface wave models finds that while comprehensive in many regards, these spectral models do not satisfy certain additional, but fundamental, criteria. We propose that these criteria include the ability to properly describe diverse fetch conditions and to provide agreement with in situ observations of Cox and Munk [1954] and Jähne and Riemer [1990] and Hara et al. [1994] data in the high-wavenumber regime. Moreover, we find numerous analytically undesirable aspects such as discontinuities across wavenumber limits, nonphysical tuning or adjustment parameters, and noncentrosymmetric directional spreading functions. This paper describes a two-dimensional wavenumber spectrum valid over all wavenumbers and analytically amenable to usage in electromagnetic models. The two regime model is formulated based on the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) in the long-wave regime and on the work of Phillips [1985] and Kitaigorodskii [1973] at the high wavenumbers. The omnidirectional and wind-dependent spectrum is constructed to agree with past and recent observations including the criteria mentioned above. The key feature of this model is the similarity of description for the high- and low-wavenumber regimes; both forms are posed to stress that the air-sea interaction process of friction between wind and waves (i.e., generalized wave age, u/c) is occurring at all wavelengths simultaneously. This wave age parameterization is the unifying feature of the spectrum. The spectrum's directional spreading function is symmetric about the wind direction and has both wavenumber and wind speed dependence. A ratio method is described that enables comparison of this spreading function with previous noncentrosymmetric forms. Radar data are purposefully excluded from this spectral development. Finally, a test of the spectrum is made by deriving roughness length using the boundary layer model of Kitaigorodskii. Our inference of drag coefficient versus wind speed and wave age shows encouraging agreement with Humidity Exchange Over the Sea (HEXOS) campaign results.},

abstract = {Abstract This work demonstrates how large-scale Aquarius satellite salinity data have provided an unprecedented opportunity when combined with total alkalinity (TA) equations as a function of salinity and temperature to examine global changes in the CO2 system. Alkalinity is a gauge on the ability of seawater to neutralize acids. TA correlates strongly with salinity. Spatial variability in alkalinity and salinity exceed temporal variability. Northern Hemisphere has more spatial variability in TA and salinity, while less variability in Southern Ocean TA is due to less salinity variability and upwelling of waters enriched in alkalinity. For the first time it is shown that TA in subtropical regions has increased as compared with climatological data; this is reflective of large-scale changes in the global water cycle. Thus, as temperature and salinity increase in subtropical regions, the resultant increase in TA and ocean acidification is reinforcing that from oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2.},

  Abstract                 = {Partially polarimetric measurements of thermal emission from a striated water surface at 91.65 GHz illustrate the potential for remote sensing of water wave direction by passive microwave radiometry. The three Stokes parameter measurements were made using a precision polarimetric radiometer trained on a rotatable water wave tank at several elevation angles from near nadir to near grazing. The polarimetric measurements are well corroborated by calculations using a tilted-facet geometrical optics model for the water surface emission and scattering. Multiple scattering of the incident background radiation is incorporated for observation angles approaching grazing. The downwelling background brightness is computed by using an atmospheric radiative transfer model. We show that azimuthal brightness variations in the third Stokes parameter are in phase quadrature with the first and second modified Stokes parameters. For observation angles near Ëœ60Â°â€“70Â° from nadir the first three parameters have particularly large azimuthal brightness variations and thus have significant potential for measuring ocean wave direction. Moreover, the azimuthal brightness variations caused by water waves are not negligible for many passive microwave atmospheric sounding and surface remote sensing purposes, even at nadir. A range of elevation angles resulting in minimal azimuthal variations is identified.},

abstract = {Abstract The sea surface temperature (SST), ocean wind speed (OWS), and sea surface salinity (SSS) are fundamental variables for understanding, monitoring, and predicting the state of the ocean and atmosphere. The analysis of these ocean parameters from passive microwave satellite measurements requires a Radiative Transfer Model (RTM). In this study, we compare three ocean RTMs from 1.4 to 89 GHz. A data set of satellite observations from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) collocated with surface and atmospheric parameters from ECMWF ERA-Interim and Mercator reanalysis has been developed. The selected ocean RTMs are as follows: LOCEAN a physical model with parameters adjusted to L band measurements, FASTEM (FAST microwave Emissivity Model) a fast parameterized model, and RSS (Remote Sensing Systems) an empirical model fitting satellite observations. Global systematic errors between simulations and observations tend to increase with frequency and are generally higher at horizontal than at vertical polarizations. Then, the analysis focuses on the accuracy of the RTMs as a function of the key ocean variables, SST, SSS, and OWS. Major discrepancies are found at frequencies above 1.4 GHz, for OWS higher than 7 m/s, with the LOCEAN and the FASTEM models, with differences strongly increasing with increasing OWS. Cold SSTs are identified as a source of disagreement between the simulations and the observations, regardless of the model. This is a critical issue, especially at 6 GHz, which is the key channel for the SST analysis from satellite. The present study is the first step toward the development of a new physically based community model.},

abstract = {The European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was launched on November 2nd, 2009. The purpose of this mission is to retrieve global maps of soil moisture and ocean surface salinity. The single payload on board the SMOS satellite is a two-dimensional L-band interferometer, the Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS). This instrument measures the cross-correlations of the signals between many pairs of receivers distributed in a Y-shaped array. After de-normalization and image reconstruction, these cross-correlations yield brightness temperature images whose usable portion extends over a swath nearly 1000km across. Geophysical retrieval algorithms are applied to these images to yield soil moisture (SM) over land and sea surface salinity (SSS) over the ocean. This paper examines the impact of sun glint on these images, focusing on the open ocean, where sun glint is shown to have a major impact on the images in descending passes from December through January. The consistency between the sun glint present in the data and that predicted by the model developed prior to launch is assessed in terms of both spatial variation across the swath and temporal variation from June 2010 to February 2014.}

abstract = {A physical model of the short wind wave spectrum in the wavelength range from a few millimeters to few meters is proposed. The spectrum shape results from the solution of the energy spectral density balance equation. Special attention is paid to the description of the capillary range of the short wave spectrum. It is assumed that in this range the spectrum shape is determined mainly by the mechanism of generation of parasitic capillaries. This is described as the cascade energy transfer from the gravity to the capillary waves. Thus the capillary wave spectrum results through the balance between generation of capillaries and their viscous dissipation. The short gravity wave spectrum results through the balance between wind input and dissipation due to wave breaking. A parameterization of wind input is obtained in part 1 of the present paper. To describe the dissipation due to wave breaking, the approach developed by Phillips [1985] is used. The spectral rate of energy dissipation is presented in the form of a power dependence of the ratio of the saturation spectrum to some threshold level. It is further shown that the threshold level depends on the drift current shift in the water viscous sublayer, which affects the energy losses by wave breaking. To obtain a short wave spectrum which is valid in the whole wavenumber domain, the capillary and the short gravity wave spectra are patched in the vicinity of the wavenumber corresponding to the minimum phase velocity. This short wave spectrum is incorporated into the wind over waves coupled model developed in part 1 of the present paper. The measured statistical properties of the sea surface related to the short waves, such as the spectral shape of omnidirectional and up-wind spectra, their wind speed dependence and angular spreading, and the wind speed dependence of integral mean square slope and skewness parameters, are well reproduced by the model. Also the model well reproduces the measured wind speed dependence of the drag coefficient and of the coupling parameter.},

abstract = {Multiscale composite models based on the Bragg theory are widely used to study the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) over the sea surface. However, these models are not able to correctly reproduce the NRCS in all configurations and wind wave conditions. We have developed a physical model that takes into account, not only the Bragg mechanism, but also the non-Bragg scattering mechanism associated with wave breaking. A single model was built to explain on the same physical basis both the background behavior of the NRCS and the wave radar Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) at HH and VV polarization. The NRCS is assumed to be the sum of a Bragg part (two-scale model) and of a non-Bragg part. The description of the sea surface is based on the short wind wave spectrum (wavelength from few millimeters to few meters) developed by Kudryavtsev et al. [1999] and wave breaking statistics proposed by Phillips [1985]. We assume that non-Bragg scattering is supported by quasi-specular reflection from very rough wave breaking patterns and that the overall contribution is proportional to the white cap coverage of the surface. A comparison of the model NRCS with observations is presented. We show that neither pure Bragg nor composite Bragg model is able to reproduce observed feature of the sea surface NRCS in a wide range of radar frequencies, wind speeds, and incidence and azimuth angles. The introduction of the non-Bragg part in the model gives an improved agreement with observations. In Part 2, we extend the model to the wave radar MTF problem.},

abstract = {A new radar imaging model of ocean current features is proposed. The simulated normalized radar cross section (NRCS) takes into account scattering from “regular” surfaces (by means of resonant Bragg scattering and specular reflections) and scattering from breaking waves. The description of background wind waves and their transformation in nonuniform medium is based on solution of the wave action conservation equation. Wave breaking plays a key role in the radar imaging model. Breaking waves scatter radio waves (thus directly contributing to the NRCS), provide energy dissipation in wind waves (thus defining the wave spectrum of intermediate scale waves), and generate short surface waves (thus affecting Bragg scattering). Surface current, surfactants accumulated in the convergence zone, and varying wind field are considered as the main sources for the NRCS manifestations of current features. The latter source can result from transformation of atmospheric boundary layer over the sea surface temperature front. It is shown that modulation of wave breaking significantly influences both radar returns and short wind waves. In the range of short gravity waves related to Ku- X-, and C-bands, the modulation of Bragg waves through wave breaking is the governing mechanism. The model is tested against well-controlled experiments including JOWIP, SARSEX, and CoastWatch-95. A reasonably good agreement between model and observations is obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {Aquarius is an L-band radar/radiometer instrument combination that has been designed to measure ocean salinity. It was launched on 10 June 2011 as part of the Aquarius/SAC-D observatory. The observatory is a partnership between the United States National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA), which provided Aquarius, and the Argentinian space agency, Comisiόn Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), which provided the spacecraft bus, Satelite de Aplicaciones Cientificas (SAC-D). The observatory was lost four years later on 7 June 2015 when a failure in the power distribution network resulted in the loss of control of the spacecraft. The Aquarius Mission formally ended on 31 December 2017. The last major milestone was the release of the final version of the salinity retrieval (Version 5). Version 5 meets the mission requirements for accuracy, and reflects the continuing progress and understanding developed by the science team over the lifetime of the mission. Further progress is possible, and several issues remained unresolved at the end of the mission that are relevant to future salinity retrievals. The understanding developed with Aquarius is being transferred to radiometer observations over the ocean from NASA&rsquo;s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, and salinity from SMAP with accuracy approaching that of Aquarius are already being produced.},

abstract = {A practical atmospheric Millimeter-Wave Propagation Model (MPM) is formulated that predicts attenuation, delay, and noise properties of moist air for frequencies up to 1000 GHz. Input variables are height distributions (0–30 km) of pressure, temperature, humidity, and suspended droplet concentration along an anticipated radio path. Spectroscopic data consist of more than 450 parameters describing local O2 and H2O absorption lines complemented by continuum spectra for dry air, water vapor, and hydrosols. For a model (MPM*) limited to frequencies below 300 GHz, the number of spectroscopic parameters can be reduced to less than 200. Recent laboratory measurements by us at 138 GHz of absolute attenuation rates for simulated air with water vapor pressures up to saturation allow the formulation of an improved, though empirical water vapor continuum. Model predictions are compared with selected (2.5–430 GHz) data from both laboratory and field experiments. In general, good agreement is obtained.},

abstract = {The mixed layer of the western equatorial Pacific and its thermodynamics are poorly known because of a general lack of data. Conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles from the recent Western Equatorial Pacific Ocean Circulation Study (WEPOCS) cruises have been analyzed for various measures of the upper layer and mixed layer thickness, using criteria which depend on vertical gradients of temperature, salinity, and density. From 434 profiles, the average mixed layer depth in the western equatorial Pacific during the two WEPOCS cruises was 29 m, which is about a factor of 3 shallower than had previously been thought. The mean depth of the top of the thermocline was found to be 64 m, so there is a nearly isothermal layer that is deeper than the mixed layer. This discrepancy is attributable to salinity stratification. It is hypothesized that the waters in this “barrier” layer between the bottom of the mixed layer and the top of the thermocline are formed to the east of the WEPOCS region, and subducted below the shallow and lighter mixed layer waters found in the west. Under light wind conditions, there was a tendency for warm and thin layers to form at the sea surface as a result of diurnal heating; however, there did not appear to be any nighttime maximum to the mixed layer depth associated with convective overturn due to cooling. This contrast with the central Pacific may be caused by the influence of salinity on the thermodynamics of the mixed layer. A strong westerly wind burst was observed during WEPOCS II, and apparently the mixed layer nearly doubled in depth while cooling by more than 1°C. Evidence of downwelling near the equator, and upwelling off the equator, was seen in the distribution of temperature, salinity, and density in the meridional section along 143°E, which was occupied immediately following the wind event. This event was apparently strong enough to erode through the salinity-stratified layer and into the thermocline, resulting in the observed cooling. The results of this study suggest that except during strong wind events, entrainment cooling may not be an important component of the heat budget of the western Pacific warm pool. This has potentially important implications for the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.},

Wind speeds up to 35 m/s are considered. Comparisons of model simulations to satellite data show that the overall accuracy of model could reach 0.2 K, which is slightly worse than the Aquarius geophysical mode function (GMF) error of about 0.14 K. The negative and positive upwind-crosswind asymmetries of L-band ocean emission and the transition of the phase signatures versus wind speed are well reproduced for all polarizations by the proposed model. The average standard deviations of the differences of polarimetric brightness temperature (TB) between observations and model are less than about 0.16 K for wind speeds up to 15 m/s. Simulations also indicate the anisotropy of L-band ocean emissivities for V- and H- pol would be saturated at high wind speeds. The directional signals at the third Stokes component begin to converge at around the wind speed of 24 m/s. The L-band TB variations due to wind direction for the third Stokes parameter show less sensitivity to wind speed at larger observation angles, while the direction-induced TB variations for the fourth Stokes are more sensitive to wind speed with the increase of observation angle.}

ABSTRACT = {Sea-ice contamination in the antenna field of view constitutes a large error source in retrieving sea-surface salinity (SSS) with the spaceborne Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band radiometer. This is a major obstacle in the current NASA/Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) SMAP SSS retrieval algorithm in regards to obtaining accurate SSS measurements in the polar oceans. Our analysis finds a strong correlation between 8-day averaged SMAP L-band brightness temperature (TB) bias and TB measurements from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR2) in the C-through Ka-band frequency range for sea-ice contaminated ocean scenes. We show how this correlation can be employed to develop: (1) a discriminant analysis that is able to reliably flag the SMAP observations for sea-ice contamination and (2) subsequently remove the sea-ice contamination from the SMAP observations, which results in significantly more accurate SMAP SSS retrievals near the sea-ice edge. We provide a case study that evaluates the performance of the proposed sea-ice flagging and correction algorithm. Our method is also able to detect drifting icebergs, which go often undetected in many available standard sea-ice products and thus result in spurious SMAP SSS retrievals.},

ABSTRACT = {A new methodology using a combination of debiased non-Bayesian retrieval, DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) and multifractal fusion has been used to obtain Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) fields over the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The debiased non-Bayesian retrieval mitigates the systematic errors produced by the contamination of the land over the sea. In addition, this retrieval improves the coverage by means of multiyear statistical filtering criteria. This methodology allows obtaining SMOS SSS fields in the Mediterranean Sea. However, the resulting SSS suffers from a seasonal (and other time-dependent) bias. This time-dependent bias has been characterized by means of specific Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs). Finally, high resolution Sea Surface Temperature (OSTIA SST) maps have been used for improving the spatial and temporal resolution of the SMOS SSS maps. The presented methodology practically reduces the error of the SMOS SSS in the Mediterranean Sea by half. As a result, the SSS dynamics described by the new SMOS maps in the Algerian Basin and the Balearic Front agrees with the one described by in situ SSS, and the mesoscale structures described by SMOS in the Alboran Sea and in the Gulf of Lion coincide with the ones described by the high resolution remotely-sensed SST images (AVHRR).},

On multi-decadal timescales, surface salinity increases (decreases) in evaporation (precipitation) dominated regions, the Atlantic?Pacific salinity contrast increases, and the upper thermocline salinity maximum increases while the salinity minimum of intermediate waters decreases. Potential trends in E?P are examined for 1950?2010 (using two reanalyses) and 1979?2010 (using four reanalyses and two blended products). Large differences in the 1950?2010 E?P trend patterns are evident in several regions, particularly the North Atlantic. For 1979?2010 some coherency in the spatial change patterns is evident but there is still a large spread in trend magnitude and sign between the six E?P products. However, a robust pattern of increased E?P in the southern hemisphere subtropical gyres is seen in all products. There is also some evidence in the tropical Pacific for a link between the spatial change patterns of salinity and E?P associated with ENSO. The water cycle amplification rate over specific regions is subsequently inferred from the observed 3-D salinity change field using a salt conservation equation in variable isopycnal volumes, implicitly accounting for the migration of isopycnal surfaces. Inferred global changes of E?P over 1950?2010 amount to an increase of 1 {$\pm$} 0.6 \% in net evaporation across the subtropics and an increase of 4.2 {$\pm$} 2 \% in net precipitation across subpolar latitudes. Amplification rates are approximately doubled over 1979?2010, consistent with accelerated broad-scale warming but also coincident with much improved salinity sampling over the latter period.}

The smooth surface is assumed specular, and the rough surface is represented by a two-scale surface, for which two small-scale perturbation parameters, 0.10 and 0.25, are considered. The contribution of the scattered sunlight to the antenna temperature is found using the scalar approximation, and the results are compared with radiometer measurements of the Cape Cod Canal. The overall agreement is good, but in some cases the smooth-surface measurements are higher than the computations. This discrepancy possibly indicates an absolute calibration error or a slight misalignment of the antennas' boresights. The computations for the two perturbation parameters bracket the rough-surface measurements except when the sun's mirror image is far removed from the boresight direction. The small disagreement in this case may be due to a peaked large-scale slope distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {A passive/active WS-band (PALS) microwave aircraft instrument to measure ocean salinity and soil moisture has been built and tested. Because the L-band brightness temperatures associated with salinity changes are expected to be small, it was necessary to build a very sensitive and stable system. This new instrument has dual-frequency, dual polarization radiometer and radar sensors. The antenna is a high beam efficiency conical horn. The PALS instrument was installed on the NCAR C-130 aircraft and soil moisture measurements were made in support of the Southern Great Plains 1999 experiment in Oklahoma from July 8-14, 1999. Data taken before and after a rainstorm showed significant changes in the brightness temperatures, polarization ratios and radar backscatter, as a function of soil moisture. Salinity measurement missions were flown on July 17-19, 1999, southeast of Norfolk, VA, over the Gulf Stream. The measurements indicated a clear and repeatable salinity signal during these three days, which was in good agreement with the Cape Hatteras ship salinity data. Data were also taken in the open ocean and a small decrease of 0.2 K was measured in the brightness temperature, which corresponded to the salinity increase of 0.4 psu measured by the M/V Oleander vessel},

abstract = {New field measurements of 2-D wave number short wind wave spectra in the wavelength range from few millimeters to few decimeters are reported and discussed. The measurement method is based on stereophotography and image brightness contrast processing. As found, the spectra of decimeter waves are almost isotropic and weakly dependent on the wind speed. Both directional anisotropy and wind sensitivity rapidly increase at wave numbers larger than 100 rad/m. These aspects are consistent with other previously reported optical and radar data. Following these new in situ measurements, a revision of a semiempirical model of short wind wave spectrum is suggested. This revised model can readily be implemented in other studies (radar scattering, air-sea interaction issues) where detailed knowledge of short wind wave spectra is crucial.},

abstract = {Scattering and absorption coefficients are presented from Monte Carlo simulations of electromagnetic wave propagation in a volume of densely packed, random dielectric, absorptive spheres. The particles are modeled both with and without a surface adhesion that causes them to form clustered groups. Results for scatterer densities greater than a few percent by volume differ significantly from those obtained under the independent-scattering assumption. The extinction rates agree well with analytic dense-medium theory. Results also show that, on account of local fields experienced by the particles, the system absorption is different from that predicted with an assumption of independent absorption. Scattering is increased when the spheres are deposited with surface adhesion that causes them to cluster and to form larger particles.},
