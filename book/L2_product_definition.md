# Level-2 product definition

The Level-2b SSS product is obtained through application of the SSS retrieval algorithm, given the Level-1b TBs. The product is provided in the L-band grid of the CIMR instrument ($xdim_{grid},ydim_{grid}$). There is also one SSS retrieval per CIMR 
look direction (aft and fore views). The product is provided in netCDF format and contains the variables listed in {numref}`L2PD`.
